CD34 is a transmembrane [glycoprotein](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/glycoprotein "Learn more about glycoprotein from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") expressed on early lymphohematopoietic stem cells, progenitor cells, and [endothelial cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/endothelial-cell "Learn more about endothelial cells from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Also, embryonic fibroblasts and some cells in fetal and adult nervous tissue are CD34-positive. Almost all hematopoietic pluripotent and committed stem cells in colony-forming assays express CD34. The uncommitted progenitor cells are CD38-negative, whereas the committed ones are mostly CD38-positive. In normal conditions, CD34-positive cells account for about 1â€“2% of the total [bone marrow cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/bone-marrow-cell "Learn more about bone marrow cells from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). The TdT+ subset of precursor B cells (hematogones) is also positive for CD34. Approximately 40% of [AMLs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acute-myelogenous-leukemia "Learn more about AMLs from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and over 50% of ALLs express CD34. CD34 is also expressed in a garden variety of nonhematopoietic tumors.
