!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = About 15 mg of tissue was placed in an extra-thick tissue processing tube (Covaris, 520140) while kept in liquid nitrogen, and repeatedly hammered to produce frozen tissue powder. The frozen tissue was transferred to lysis buffer of 0.2% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor (Roche, 04-693-159-001), 1 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich, D9779), 0.2 U/µL RNAsin (Promega, N211B), and 2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, SRE0036) in PBS. Sample was pipetted 10 times, rotated for 5 min at 4°C, and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in sorting buffer of 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 U/µL RNAsin, and 2% BSA in PBS, and passed through a 30 µm strainer (Sysmex, 04-0042-2316) to remove excessive debris. The nuclei were stained with DRAQ7 (1:100, Cell Signaling, 7406) for snRNA-seq, and with DAPI (10 ug/mL, Sigma, 32670) for snATAC-seq. Between 100,000 and 150,000 nuclei were sorted using a MoFlo Astrios EQ sorter (Beckman coulter, laser/filter) into a collection tube with 1 U/ µL RNAsin and 5% BSA in PBS. Sorted nuclei were centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and supernatant was removed. Nuclei were resuspended in resuspension buffer (0.2 U/µL RNAsin and 1% BSA in PBS) and counted using a cell counter (Cellometer Auto 2000, Nexcelom Biosicence) with AO/PI staining.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = We generated snRNA-seq libraries using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics).
!Sample_data_processing = To demultiplex the data for pooled libraries, the nuclei were clustered based on individual genetic variants using souporcell, and assigned to the corresponding donor by matching the genetic variants obtained from bulk RNA-seq data. The genetic variants from bulk RNA-seq data was obtained by using freebayes (-iXu -C 2 -q 20 -n 3 -E 1 -m 30 --min-coverage 20 --pooled-continuous --skip-coverage 100000). The feature-barcode matrix was generated using cellranger count (10x Genomics, v3.0.2), aligning the sequenced reads to the human reference genome (hg19; 10x Cell Ranger reference GRCh37 v3.0.0). Then the count matrices were aggregated by cellranger aggr function across the samples with default parameters. The following analysis was performed using Seurat R package v4.0.5. Nuclei with fewer than 200 or greater than 10,000 genes detected were filtered from the snRNA-seq dataset. Low-quality nuclei with mapped reads in the mitochondrial genes greater than 10% were removed. Doublets were identified using Scrublet, and nuclei with doublet score greater than 0.4 were excluded from analysis. The snRNA-seq data was integrated to correct for technical differences across individual samples. For this, the feature-barcode matrix was individually normalized by the total read count and log transformed, and top 5,000 variable genes were selected for each sample using Seurat’s FindVariableFeatures function. Data integration was conducted based on anchors identified by using FindIntegrationAnchors function. The aligned nuclei were scaled, and principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the scaled expression matrix. The top 45 principal components (PCs) were used to compute Shared Nearest Neighbors (SNNs), which were then used to cluster nuclei based on the Louvain algorithm (resolution = 1.5) in FindClusters function in Seurat R package. The top 45 PCs were used for the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embedding.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = About 15 mg of tissue was placed in an extra-thick tissue processing tube (Covaris, 520140) while kept in liquid nitrogen, and repeatedly hammered to produce frozen tissue powder. The frozen tissue was transferred to lysis buffer of 0.2% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor (Roche, 04-693-159-001), 1 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich, D9779), 0.2 U/µL RNAsin (Promega, N211B), and 2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, SRE0036) in PBS. Sample was pipetted 10 times, rotated for 5 min at 4°C, and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in sorting buffer of 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 U/µL RNAsin, and 2% BSA in PBS, and passed through a 30 µm strainer (Sysmex, 04-0042-2316) to remove excessive debris. The nuclei were stained with DRAQ7 (1:100, Cell Signaling, 7406) for snRNA-seq, and with DAPI (10 ug/mL, Sigma, 32670) for snATAC-seq. Between 100,000 and 150,000 nuclei were sorted using a MoFlo Astrios EQ sorter (Beckman coulter, laser/filter) into a collection tube with 1 U/ µL RNAsin and 5% BSA in PBS. Sorted nuclei were centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and supernatant was removed. Nuclei were resuspended in resuspension buffer (0.2 U/µL RNAsin and 1% BSA in PBS) and counted using a cell counter (Cellometer Auto 2000, Nexcelom Biosicence) with AO/PI staining.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = We generated snRNA-seq libraries using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics).
!Sample_data_processing = To demultiplex the data for pooled libraries, the nuclei were clustered based on individual genetic variants using souporcell, and assigned to the corresponding donor by matching the genetic variants obtained from bulk RNA-seq data. The genetic variants from bulk RNA-seq data was obtained by using freebayes (-iXu -C 2 -q 20 -n 3 -E 1 -m 30 --min-coverage 20 --pooled-continuous --skip-coverage 100000). The feature-barcode matrix was generated using cellranger count (10x Genomics, v3.0.2), aligning the sequenced reads to the human reference genome (hg19; 10x Cell Ranger reference GRCh37 v3.0.0). Then the count matrices were aggregated by cellranger aggr function across the samples with default parameters. The following analysis was performed using Seurat R package v4.0.5. Nuclei with fewer than 200 or greater than 10,000 genes detected were filtered from the snRNA-seq dataset. Low-quality nuclei with mapped reads in the mitochondrial genes greater than 10% were removed. Doublets were identified using Scrublet, and nuclei with doublet score greater than 0.4 were excluded from analysis. The snRNA-seq data was integrated to correct for technical differences across individual samples. For this, the feature-barcode matrix was individually normalized by the total read count and log transformed, and top 5,000 variable genes were selected for each sample using Seurat’s FindVariableFeatures function. Data integration was conducted based on anchors identified by using FindIntegrationAnchors function. The aligned nuclei were scaled, and principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the scaled expression matrix. The top 45 principal components (PCs) were used to compute Shared Nearest Neighbors (SNNs), which were then used to cluster nuclei based on the Louvain algorithm (resolution = 1.5) in FindClusters function in Seurat R package. The top 45 PCs were used for the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embedding.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = About 15 mg of tissue was placed in an extra-thick tissue processing tube (Covaris, 520140) while kept in liquid nitrogen, and repeatedly hammered to produce frozen tissue powder. The frozen tissue was transferred to lysis buffer of 0.2% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor (Roche, 04-693-159-001), 1 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich, D9779), 0.2 U/µL RNAsin (Promega, N211B), and 2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, SRE0036) in PBS. Sample was pipetted 10 times, rotated for 5 min at 4°C, and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in sorting buffer of 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 U/µL RNAsin, and 2% BSA in PBS, and passed through a 30 µm strainer (Sysmex, 04-0042-2316) to remove excessive debris. The nuclei were stained with DRAQ7 (1:100, Cell Signaling, 7406) for snRNA-seq, and with DAPI (10 ug/mL, Sigma, 32670) for snATAC-seq. Between 100,000 and 150,000 nuclei were sorted using a MoFlo Astrios EQ sorter (Beckman coulter, laser/filter) into a collection tube with 1 U/ µL RNAsin and 5% BSA in PBS. Sorted nuclei were centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and supernatant was removed. Nuclei were resuspended in resuspension buffer (0.2 U/µL RNAsin and 1% BSA in PBS) and counted using a cell counter (Cellometer Auto 2000, Nexcelom Biosicence) with AO/PI staining.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = We generated snRNA-seq libraries using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics).
!Sample_data_processing = To demultiplex the data for pooled libraries, the nuclei were clustered based on individual genetic variants using souporcell, and assigned to the corresponding donor by matching the genetic variants obtained from bulk RNA-seq data. The genetic variants from bulk RNA-seq data was obtained by using freebayes (-iXu -C 2 -q 20 -n 3 -E 1 -m 30 --min-coverage 20 --pooled-continuous --skip-coverage 100000). The feature-barcode matrix was generated using cellranger count (10x Genomics, v3.0.2), aligning the sequenced reads to the human reference genome (hg19; 10x Cell Ranger reference GRCh37 v3.0.0). Then the count matrices were aggregated by cellranger aggr function across the samples with default parameters. The following analysis was performed using Seurat R package v4.0.5. Nuclei with fewer than 200 or greater than 10,000 genes detected were filtered from the snRNA-seq dataset. Low-quality nuclei with mapped reads in the mitochondrial genes greater than 10% were removed. Doublets were identified using Scrublet, and nuclei with doublet score greater than 0.4 were excluded from analysis. The snRNA-seq data was integrated to correct for technical differences across individual samples. For this, the feature-barcode matrix was individually normalized by the total read count and log transformed, and top 5,000 variable genes were selected for each sample using Seurat’s FindVariableFeatures function. Data integration was conducted based on anchors identified by using FindIntegrationAnchors function. The aligned nuclei were scaled, and principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the scaled expression matrix. The top 45 principal components (PCs) were used to compute Shared Nearest Neighbors (SNNs), which were then used to cluster nuclei based on the Louvain algorithm (resolution = 1.5) in FindClusters function in Seurat R package. The top 45 PCs were used for the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embedding.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = snATAC-seq libraries were generated using the Chromium Single Cell ATAC Library & Gel Bead Kit v1 (10x Genomics).
!Sample_data_processing = To demultiplex the data for pooled libraries, the nuclei were clustered based on individual genetic variants using souporcell, using the same parameters (--min_alt 8 --min_ref 8 --no_umi True --skip_remap True --ignore True) used in Fiskin et al. study. The genetic variants from bulk ChIP-seq data was obtained by using freebayes (-iXu -C 2 -q 20 -n 3 -E 1 -m 30 --min-coverage 20 --pooled-continuous --skip-coverage 100000). The feature-barcode matrix was generated using the cellranger-atac count (10x Genomics, v1.1.0), aligning the sequenced reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19). Then the count matrices were aggregated by cellranger-atac aggr function with default parameters. The following analysis was performed using Signac R package v1.4.0. Nucleosome signal was computed with Signac’s NucleosomeSignal function. Low-quality nuclei were removed from snATAC-seq dataset based on the following criteria: fewer than 2,000 or greater than 30,000 fragments mapped to peak regions, less than 15% of reads in peak regions, nucleosome signal greater than 10, and transcription start site (TSS) enrichment less than 2. Doublets were identified using Scrublet, and excluded from analysis. We selected top 50% most common features as the variable features, and performed LSI dimensionality reduction by implementing term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) transformation followed by singular value decomposition (SVD). Then, reciprocal LSI projection was conducted to identify integration anchors for each sample, and the snATAC-seq data was integrated across the samples by using low-dimensional cell embeddings with Signac’s IntegrateEmbeddings function. The identical method used in snRNA-seq for graph-based clustering and non-linear dimension reduction by UMAP was applied to the snATAC-seq dataset. Gene activity scores were computed for protein coding genes by summing snATAC-seq reads mapped in the gene body and the promoter (5 kb upstream to TSS) by using GeneActivity function in Signac R package.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = About 15 mg of tissue was placed in an extra-thick tissue processing tube (Covaris, 520140) while kept in liquid nitrogen, and repeatedly hammered to produce frozen tissue powder. The frozen tissue was transferred to lysis buffer of 0.2% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor (Roche, 04-693-159-001), 1 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich, D9779), 0.2 U/µL RNAsin (Promega, N211B), and 2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, SRE0036) in PBS. Sample was pipetted 10 times, rotated for 5 min at 4°C, and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in sorting buffer of 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 U/µL RNAsin, and 2% BSA in PBS, and passed through a 30 µm strainer (Sysmex, 04-0042-2316) to remove excessive debris. The nuclei were stained with DRAQ7 (1:100, Cell Signaling, 7406) for snRNA-seq, and with DAPI (10 ug/mL, Sigma, 32670) for snATAC-seq. Between 100,000 and 150,000 nuclei were sorted using a MoFlo Astrios EQ sorter (Beckman coulter, laser/filter) into a collection tube with 1 U/ µL RNAsin and 5% BSA in PBS. Sorted nuclei were centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and supernatant was removed. Nuclei were resuspended in resuspension buffer (0.2 U/µL RNAsin and 1% BSA in PBS) and counted using a cell counter (Cellometer Auto 2000, Nexcelom Biosicence) with AO/PI staining. The isolated nuclei were subject to permeabilization in a lysis buffer with Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40 Substitute (Sigma-Aldrich, 74385), 0.01% digitonin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, BN2006), and 1% BSA.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = snATAC-seq libraries were generated using the Chromium Single Cell ATAC Library & Gel Bead Kit v1 (10x Genomics).
!Sample_data_processing = To demultiplex the data for pooled libraries, the nuclei were clustered based on individual genetic variants using souporcell, using the same parameters (--min_alt 8 --min_ref 8 --no_umi True --skip_remap True --ignore True) used in Fiskin et al. study. The genetic variants from bulk ChIP-seq data was obtained by using freebayes (-iXu -C 2 -q 20 -n 3 -E 1 -m 30 --min-coverage 20 --pooled-continuous --skip-coverage 100000). The feature-barcode matrix was generated using the cellranger-atac count (10x Genomics, v1.1.0), aligning the sequenced reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19). Then the count matrices were aggregated by cellranger-atac aggr function with default parameters. The following analysis was performed using Signac R package v1.4.0. Nucleosome signal was computed with Signac’s NucleosomeSignal function. Low-quality nuclei were removed from snATAC-seq dataset based on the following criteria: fewer than 2,000 or greater than 30,000 fragments mapped to peak regions, less than 15% of reads in peak regions, nucleosome signal greater than 10, and transcription start site (TSS) enrichment less than 2. Doublets were identified using Scrublet, and excluded from analysis. We selected top 50% most common features as the variable features, and performed LSI dimensionality reduction by implementing term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) transformation followed by singular value decomposition (SVD). Then, reciprocal LSI projection was conducted to identify integration anchors for each sample, and the snATAC-seq data was integrated across the samples by using low-dimensional cell embeddings with Signac’s IntegrateEmbeddings function. The identical method used in snRNA-seq for graph-based clustering and non-linear dimension reduction by UMAP was applied to the snATAC-seq dataset. Gene activity scores were computed for protein coding genes by summing snATAC-seq reads mapped in the gene body and the promoter (5 kb upstream to TSS) by using GeneActivity function in Signac R package.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = About 15 mg of tissue was placed in an extra-thick tissue processing tube (Covaris, 520140) while kept in liquid nitrogen, and repeatedly hammered to produce frozen tissue powder. The frozen tissue was transferred to lysis buffer of 0.2% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor (Roche, 04-693-159-001), 1 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich, D9779), 0.2 U/µL RNAsin (Promega, N211B), and 2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, SRE0036) in PBS. Sample was pipetted 10 times, rotated for 5 min at 4°C, and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in sorting buffer of 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 U/µL RNAsin, and 2% BSA in PBS, and passed through a 30 µm strainer (Sysmex, 04-0042-2316) to remove excessive debris. The nuclei were stained with DRAQ7 (1:100, Cell Signaling, 7406) for snRNA-seq, and with DAPI (10 ug/mL, Sigma, 32670) for snATAC-seq. Between 100,000 and 150,000 nuclei were sorted using a MoFlo Astrios EQ sorter (Beckman coulter, laser/filter) into a collection tube with 1 U/ µL RNAsin and 5% BSA in PBS. Sorted nuclei were centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and supernatant was removed. Nuclei were resuspended in resuspension buffer (0.2 U/µL RNAsin and 1% BSA in PBS) and counted using a cell counter (Cellometer Auto 2000, Nexcelom Biosicence) with AO/PI staining. The isolated nuclei were subject to permeabilization in a lysis buffer with Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40 Substitute (Sigma-Aldrich, 74385), 0.01% digitonin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, BN2006), and 1% BSA.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = snATAC-seq libraries were generated using the Chromium Single Cell ATAC Library & Gel Bead Kit v1 (10x Genomics).
!Sample_data_processing = To demultiplex the data for pooled libraries, the nuclei were clustered based on individual genetic variants using souporcell, using the same parameters (--min_alt 8 --min_ref 8 --no_umi True --skip_remap True --ignore True) used in Fiskin et al. study. The genetic variants from bulk ChIP-seq data was obtained by using freebayes (-iXu -C 2 -q 20 -n 3 -E 1 -m 30 --min-coverage 20 --pooled-continuous --skip-coverage 100000). The feature-barcode matrix was generated using the cellranger-atac count (10x Genomics, v1.1.0), aligning the sequenced reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19). Then the count matrices were aggregated by cellranger-atac aggr function with default parameters. The following analysis was performed using Signac R package v1.4.0. Nucleosome signal was computed with Signac’s NucleosomeSignal function. Low-quality nuclei were removed from snATAC-seq dataset based on the following criteria: fewer than 2,000 or greater than 30,000 fragments mapped to peak regions, less than 15% of reads in peak regions, nucleosome signal greater than 10, and transcription start site (TSS) enrichment less than 2. Doublets were identified using Scrublet, and excluded from analysis. We selected top 50% most common features as the variable features, and performed LSI dimensionality reduction by implementing term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) transformation followed by singular value decomposition (SVD). Then, reciprocal LSI projection was conducted to identify integration anchors for each sample, and the snATAC-seq data was integrated across the samples by using low-dimensional cell embeddings with Signac’s IntegrateEmbeddings function. The identical method used in snRNA-seq for graph-based clustering and non-linear dimension reduction by UMAP was applied to the snATAC-seq dataset. Gene activity scores were computed for protein coding genes by summing snATAC-seq reads mapped in the gene body and the promoter (5 kb upstream to TSS) by using GeneActivity function in Signac R package.

The frozen tissue was transferred to lysis buffer of 0.2% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor (Roche, 04-693-159-001), 1 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich, D9779), 0.2 U/µL RNAsin (Promega, N211B), and 2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, SRE0036) in PBS. Sample was pipetted 10 times, rotated for 5 min at 4°C, and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in sorting buffer of 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 U/µL RNAsin, and 2% BSA in PBS, and passed through a 30 µm strainer (Sysmex, 04-0042-2316) to remove excessive debris. The nuclei were stained with DRAQ7 (1:100, Cell Signaling, 7406) for snRNA-seq, and with DAPI (10 ug/mL, Sigma, 32670) for snATAC-seq. Between 100,000 and 150,000 nuclei were sorted using a MoFlo Astrios EQ sorter (Beckman coulter, laser/filter) into a collection tube with 1 U/ µL RNAsin and 5% BSA in PBS. Sorted nuclei were centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and supernatant was removed. Nuclei were resuspended in resuspension buffer (0.2 U/µL RNAsin and 1% BSA in PBS) and counted using a cell counter (Cellometer Auto 2000, Nexcelom Biosicence) with AO/PI staining. The isolated nuclei were subject to permeabilization in a lysis buffer with Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40 Substitute (Sigma-Aldrich, 74385), 0.01% digitonin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, BN2006), and 1% BSA.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = snATAC-seq libraries were generated using the Chromium Single Cell ATAC Library & Gel Bead Kit v1 (10x Genomics).
!Sample_data_processing = To demultiplex the data for pooled libraries, the nuclei were clustered based on individual genetic variants using souporcell, using the same parameters (--min_alt 8 --min_ref 8 --no_umi True --skip_remap True --ignore True) used in Fiskin et al. study. The genetic variants from bulk ChIP-seq data was obtained by using freebayes (-iXu -C 2 -q 20 -n 3 -E 1 -m 30 --min-coverage 20 --pooled-continuous --skip-coverage 100000). The feature-barcode matrix was generated using the cellranger-atac count (10x Genomics, v1.1.0), aligning the sequenced reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19). Then the count matrices were aggregated by cellranger-atac aggr function with default parameters. The following analysis was performed using Signac R package v1.4.0. Nucleosome signal was computed with Signac’s NucleosomeSignal function. Low-quality nuclei were removed from snATAC-seq dataset based on the following criteria: fewer than 2,000 or greater than 30,000 fragments mapped to peak regions, less than 15% of reads in peak regions, nucleosome signal greater than 10, and transcription start site (TSS) enrichment less than 2. Doublets were identified using Scrublet, and excluded from analysis. We selected top 50% most common features as the variable features, and performed LSI dimensionality reduction by implementing term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) transformation followed by singular value decomposition (SVD). Then, reciprocal LSI projection was conducted to identify integration anchors for each sample, and the snATAC-seq data was integrated across the samples by using low-dimensional cell embeddings with Signac’s IntegrateEmbeddings function. The identical method used in snRNA-seq for graph-based clustering and non-linear dimension reduction by UMAP was applied to the snATAC-seq dataset. Gene activity scores were computed for protein coding genes by summing snATAC-seq reads mapped in the gene body and the promoter (5 kb upstream to TSS) by using GeneActivity function in Signac R package.
