  "series_summary": "Cell types in the human retina are highly heterogeneous with\
    \ their abundance varies by several orders of magnitude. To decipher the complexity\
    \ of gene expression and regulation of the human retinal cell types, we generated\
    \ a multi-omics single-cell atlas of the adult human retina, including over 250K\
    \ nuclei for single-nuclei RNA-seq and 150K nuclei for single-nuclei ATAC-seq.\
    \ Over 60 cell subtypes have been identified based on their transcriptomic profiles,\
    \ reaching a sensitivity of 0.01%. Integrative analysis of this single-cell multi-omics\
    \ dataset identified gene regulatory elements across the genome for each cell\
    \ subtype. In addition, when combined with other data modalities, such as eQTL,\
    \ potential causal variants can be identified through fine mapping. Taken together,\
    \ this new dataset represents the most comprehensive single-cell multi-omics profiling\
    \ for the human retina that enables in-depth molecular characterization of most\
    \ cell subtypes."
