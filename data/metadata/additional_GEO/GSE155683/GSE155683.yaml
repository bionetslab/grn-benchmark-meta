  "series_summary": "To study the development and composition of human ocular surface,\
    \ we performed single cell (sc) RNA-Seq at key embryonic, fetal and adult stages\
    \ and generated the first atlas of the corneal and conjunctival cell types from\
    \ development to adulthood. The conjunctival epithelium is the first to be specified\
    \ in the epithelial layer\_, followed by the corneal epithelium and the establishment\
    \ of proliferative epithelial progenitors, which predate the formation of limbal\
    \ niche by a few weeks. Bioinformatic comparison of adult cell clusters identified\
    \ GPHA2,a novel cell-surface marker for quiescent limbal stem cells (qLSCs), whose\
    \ function is to maintain qLSCs self-renewal. Combining scRNA- and ATAC-Seq analysis,\
    \ we identified multiple upstream regulators for qLSCs and transit amplifying\
    \ (TA) cells and demonstrated a close interaction between the immune cells and\
    \ epithelial stem and progenitor cells in the cornea. Single cell RNA-Seq analysis\
    \ indicated loss of qLSCs and acquisition of proliferative limbal epithelial progenitor\
    \ markers during limbal epithelial cell expansion: this phenomenon was independent\
    \ of culture method used. Extending the single cell analyses to Keratoconus, we\
    \ were able to reveal activation of collagenase in the corneal stroma and a reduced\
    \ pool of TA cells in the corneal epithelium as two key mechanistic changes underlying\
    \ the disease phenotype. Our scRNA-Seq data comparisons of developing and adult\
    \ cornea and conjunctiva provide a unique resource for defining pathways/genes\
    \ that could lead to improvement in ex vivo expansion methods for cell based replacement\
    \ therapies and better understanding and treatment of ocular surface disorders."
