  "series_summary": "Human adult spermatogenesis involves a balance of spermatogonial\
    \ stem cell self renewal and differentiation, alongside complex germline-niche\
    \ interactions. To better understand, we performed single cell RNA sequencing\
    \ of ~7000 testis cells from three healthy men of peak reproductive age. Our analyses\
    \ revealed multiple distinctive transcriptional \u2018states\u2019 of self-renewing\
    \ and differentiating spermatogonia, the cellular stages of gametogenesis, five\
    \ niche cells (Leydig, Myoid, Sertoli, Endothelial, macrophage) and insights into\
    \ germline-niche communication. Spermatogenesis was reconstructed computationally,\
    \ which identified sequential coding, noncoding, and repeat-element transcriptional\
    \ signatures. A new, developmentally early and likely quiescent spermatogonial\
    \ state is identified (GFRA1-/ETV5-/ID4+/UTF1+/FGFR3+). Notably, certain epigenetic\
    \ features combined with nascent transcription analyses suggest considerable plasticity\
    \ within certain spermatogonial populations/states. Key findings were validated\
    \ via RNA and protein staining. Taken together, we provided the first \u201CCell\
    \ Atlas\u201D of the adult human testis, and provide multiple new insights into\
    \ germ cell development and germ cell \u2013 niche interaction."

    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Single testicular cells were generated using standard two step enzymatic digestion protocol as described before (Guo et al., Cell Stel Cell 2017). Cell suspension was centrifuged and resuspended in cold PBS buffer with 0.4% of BSA at the concentration of ~1000/ul, which then was loaded onto the 10X Chromium Controller using Chromium Single Cell 3’ v2 reagents., Sequencing library was prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions (10X Genomics), with 13 cycles used for cDNA amplification and 12 cycles for library amplification, which was then sequenced on a 26 X 100 cycle paired-end run via a Illumina 2500 instrument. Samples from Donor 1 was sequenced in two separate sequencing lanes. For Donors 2 and 3, their libraries were mixed before sequencing, and seqenced by four different lanes., 10X Genomics single cell RNA sequencing"
    sample_data_processing: "Samples were sequenced as paired end sequencing. Raw data were firstly demultiplexed using mkfastq application (Cell Ranger v1.2.1). Three types of fastq files were generated: I1 contains 8 bp sample index; R1 contains 26 bp (10 cell + 16 UMI) index and R2 contains 100 bp cDNA sequence. Fastq files were then run with count application (Cell Ranger v1.2.1) using default settings, which performs alignment (using STAR aligner), filtering and UMI counting. The UMI count table was used for further analysis."
    supplementary_files_format_and_content: "tab-delimited text files include UMI numbers for all genes and single cells that passed filtering"
