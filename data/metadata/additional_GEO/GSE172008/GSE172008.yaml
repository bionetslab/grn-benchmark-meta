  "series_summary": "The functional interpretation of GWAS remains challenging due\
    \ to the cell-type dependent influences of genetic variants. Here, we generated\
    \ comprehensive maps of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for 659 microdissected\
    \ human kidney samples and identified cell-type eQTLs by mapping interactions\
    \ between cell type abundance and genotype. By partitioning heritability using\
    \ stratified LD-score regression to integrate GWAS with scRNA-seq and snATAC-seq\
    \ data, we prioritized proximal tubules in kidney function and endothelial cells\
    \ and distal tubule segments in blood pressure pathogenesis. Bayesian colocalization\
    \ analysis nominated more than 200 genes for kidney function and hypertension.\
    \ Our study clarifies the mechanism of commonly used antihypertensive and renal\
    \ protective drugs and identifies drug repurposing opportunities for kidney disease."
