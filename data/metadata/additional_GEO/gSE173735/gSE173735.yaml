  "series_summary": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is continuum of disorders among\
    \ which non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is particularly associated with a\
    \ negative prognosis. Hepatocyte lipotoxicity is one of the main pathogenic factors\
    \ of liver fibrosis and NASH. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating this\
    \ process are poorly understood. Here, we integrated transcriptomic and chromatin\
    \ accessibility analyses from human liver and mouse hepatocytes to identify lipotoxicity-sensitive\
    \ transcription factors. We found that several transcription factors that were\
    \ activated in liver from NASH patients and by mouse hepatocyte lipotoxicity.\
    \ Notably, the gene expression linked to lipotoxicity closely correlated with\
    \ transcriptional patters in fibrosis progression in NASH patients. Collectively,\
    \ our findings uncovered novel molecular insights into lipotoxicity-induced NASH."

    sample_treatment_protocol_ch1: "FL83B cells were incubated in 400 µM palmitate diluted in growth medium for 24 h. One percent BSA diluted in growth medium was used as control. Moreover, gene knockout was achieved by the CRISPR-Cas9 system, using non-targeting agRNA (control) and Tcf4 or Mafk sgRNA."
    sample_growth_protocol_ch1: "FL83B mouse hepatocytes (ATCC®, #CRL-2390™) were grown in F-12K medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #21127030) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (growth medium). Cells were maintained at 37°C, 95% O2 and 5% CO2."
    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Cells were collected in TRI Reagent (Sigma #T9424), following which RNA was purified using Direct-zol™ RNA MiniPrep (Zymo Research, #R2050)., Libraries from human liver tissue and wild type FL83B cells were prepared with TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina, #20020599). Libraries from knockout FL83B cells and their corresponding non-targeting controls were prepared with TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Kit (Illumina, #20020595)."
    sample_data_processing: "Single-read sequencing was performed using the NextSeq 500 (Illumina). Pair-end sequencing was performed using the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina)., All data was analysed on the Galaxy platform (https://usegalaxy.eu/). Reads were trimmed with Trim Galore! (Galaxy version 0.4.3.1) and quality was assessed using FastQC (Galaxy version 0.72+galaxy1). Reads were aligned to the hg38 or mm10 version of the human and mouse genome, respectively, using STAR (Galaxy version 2.7.7a). Strand specificity and read counting was performed with Infer Experiment (Galaxy version 2.6.4.1) and featureCounts (Galaxy version 2.0.1), respectively. Next, we used DESeq2 (Galaxy version 2.11.40.6+galaxy1) for differential expression analysis and the resulting data was annotated with Annotate DESeq2/DEXSeq output tables (Galaxy version 1.1.0)."
