(Galaxy version 0.4.3.1) and quality was assessed using FastQC (Galaxy version 0.72+galaxy1). Reads were aligned to the hg38 or mm10 version of the human and mouse genome, respectively, using STAR (Galaxy version 2.7.7a). Strand specificity and read counting was performed with Infer Experiment (Galaxy version 2.6.4.1) and featureCounts (Galaxy version 2.0.1), respectively. Next, we used DESeq2 (Galaxy version 2.11.40.6+galaxy1) for differential expression analysis and the resulting data was annotated with Annotate DESeq2/DEXSeq output tables (Galaxy version 1.1.0).
