Single-nuclei suspension was loaded on a Chromium controller to obtain single cell GEMS (Gel Beads-In-Emulsions) for the reaction. The snRNA-seq library was prepared with Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ Kit v3.1 (10x Genomics).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = [enrichment protocol] Isolated nuclei were stained with mouse anti-NeuN monoclonal antibody (1:5000, Alexa Flour 488 Conjugate MAB377X, Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, United States) in pre-chilled fresh-made wash buffer (1% BSA in PBS, 0.2U/μl RNAse inhibitor) for 30min at 4°C. Stained nuclei were sorted with a FACS Aria II flow sorter (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), (70μm nozzle).   For the NeuNM group, the nuclei with the 5-10% FITC range strongest signal were collected.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Human retina samples were collected by the Utah Lions Eye Bank within 6 hours postmortem and were confirmed to be free of drusen, atrophy, or other disease pathology. The fovea and macula samples were collected separately, using a 4 mm and 6 mm disposable biopsy punch, respectively, and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were then stored at −80 °C before nuclei isolation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Human retina samples were collected by the Utah Lions Eye Bank within 6 hours postmortem and were confirmed to be free of drusen, atrophy, or other disease pathology. The fovea and macula samples were collected separately, using a 4 mm and 6 mm disposable biopsy punch, respectively, and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were then stored at −80 °C before nuclei isolation.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Nuclei were isolated by pre-chilled fresh-made RNase-free lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.02% NP40). The frozen tissue was resuspended and triturated to break the tissue structure in lysis buffer and homogenized with a Wheaton™ Dounce Tissue Grinder.

The snATAC-seq library was prepared with Chromium Next GEM Single Cell ATAC Library & Gel Bead Kit v1.1 (10x Genomics).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Human retina samples were collected by the Utah Lions Eye Bank within 6 hours postmortem and were confirmed to be free of drusen, atrophy, or other disease pathology. The fovea and macula samples were collected separately, using a 4 mm and 6 mm disposable biopsy punch, respectively, and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were then stored at −80 °C before nuclei isolation.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Nuclei were isolated by pre-chilled fresh-made RNase-free lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.02% NP40). The frozen tissue was resuspended and triturated to break the tissue structure in lysis buffer and homogenized with a Wheaton™ Dounce Tissue Grinder.
