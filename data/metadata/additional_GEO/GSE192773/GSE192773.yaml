  "series_summary": "Genomic changes acquired in human evolution contribute to the\
    \ unique abilities of human brain. However, characterizing the molecular underpinnings\
    \ of human-specific traits is a multifaceted challenge due to the cellular heterogeneity\
    \ of human brain and complex regulation of gene expression. Here, we performed\
    \ single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) and single-nuclei ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq)\
    \ in human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque brain tissue (brodmann area 23, posterior\
    \ cingulate cortex). Human-specific changes were distinct among neuronal subtypes\
    \ indicating that human brain evolution was accompanied by molecular alterations\
    \ in finer cellular resolution.  We also observed more human-specific alterations\
    \ in epigenome compared to transcriptome. Interestingly, human-specific accessibility\
    \ changes in neurons were not as concordant with gene expression changes in comparison\
    \ to other species, partially explaining this discrepancy. These cis-regulatory\
    \ elements were enriched for immediate early gene motifs, identifying accelerated\
    \ evolution of activity regulated genes in humans. We also uncovered associations\
    \ between human evolution and brain disease genes at the cell type level. Together,\
    \ these results reveal multiple mechanisms for human brain evolution at cell type\
    \ resolution and establish the first direct evidence for accelerated human-specificity\
    \ of activity-dependent molecular changes."
