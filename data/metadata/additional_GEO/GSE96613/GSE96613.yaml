  "series_summary": "We analyzed differential methylation (via WGBS) between four\
    \ distinct human brain regions (NAcc-nucleus accumbens, BA9-dorsolateral prefrontal\
    \ cortex, BA24-anterior cingulate cortex, and HC-hippocampus) in both sorted nuclei\
    \ and intact tissues. We isolated neuronal and non-neuronal (glial) nuclei from\
    \ the same six individuals for each tissue via FACS using the neuronal marker,\
    \ NeuN. Additionally, we performed WGBS from non-sorted tissues from these same\
    \ brain regions in a total of 12 individuals (BA9 n 9; BA24 n 5; HC n 6; NAcc\
    \ n 7). To complement our DNA methylation analyses, we measured gene expression\
    \ (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) in neuronal and non-neuronal\
    \ nuclei from the nucleus accumbens and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from six\
    \ more individuals. We then performed an integrative analysis to understand how\
    \ the epigenome contributes to brain region-specific function."

    # Project metadata:
    sample_treatment_protocol_ch1: "RNA was extracted from neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei isolated from nucleus accumbens or prefrontal cortex (BA9) tissues (for samples with _pos or _neg at end of sample ID) and sorted via FACS based on NeuN staining as in Montano et al. 2013."
    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (cat#: 74104 ), SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit â€“ Pico Input Mammalian"
    sample_data_processing: "We trimmed the first 3 bp of read1, which were derived from template switching oligos and not the cDNA of interest, using seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk; v1.2-r94) with the following parameters: seqtk trimfq -b 3 ${READ1}. We then quasi-mapped these trimmed reads to a FASTA file of protein-coding and lncRNA genes from GENCODE v19 (http://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/19.html) and performed transcript-level quantification using Salmon (v0.7.2)., We used tximport (v1.2.0) to compute normalized gene-level counts from the transcript-level abundance estimates (scaling these using the average transcript length over samples and the library size). Only autosomal genes with at least 1 cpm in at least 4 libraries (the size of the smallest group of samples) were retained for downstream analysis."
