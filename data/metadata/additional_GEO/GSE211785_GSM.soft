!Sample_data_processing = RNA-Seq: “cellranger count” aligned the Read2 to the human reference genome (GRCh38).
!Sample_data_processing = RNA-Seq: Aligned reads were used to generate data matrix only when they have valid barcodes and UMI, map to exons (GRCh38)
!Sample_data_processing = RNA-Seq: The data matrix of each sample was corrected in terms of ambient RNA using SoupX.
!Sample_data_processing = RNA-Seq: The output files for 29 samples were aggregated into one gene-cell matrix using Seurat v. 4.0.1.
!Sample_data_processing = RNA-Seq: Once the gene-cell data matrix was generated, poor quality cells were excluded, such as cells with <200 genes detected or with >3,000 unique expressed genes (as they are potentially cell doublets). Cells were also discarded if their mitochondrial gene percentages were over 50%.
