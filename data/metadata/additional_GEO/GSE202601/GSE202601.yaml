  "series_summary": "The ovary is the first organ to age in the human body, affecting\
    \ both fertility and overall health in women1-8. However, the biological mechanisms\
    \ underlying human ovarian ageing remain poorly understood. Here we performed\
    \ single-cell multi-omics analysis of young and reproductively aged human ovaries\
    \ to understand the molecular and cellular basis of ovarian ageing in humans.\
    \ Our analysis reveals coordinated changes in transcriptomic output and chromatin\
    \ accessibility across cell types during ageing, including elevated mTOR and MAPK\
    \ signaling, decreased activity of the oxidative phosphorylation and DNA damage\
    \ repair pathways, and an increased signature of cellular senescence. By constructing\
    \ cell type-specific regulatory networks, we uncover enhanced activity of the\
    \ transcription factor CEBPD across cell types in the aged ovary, with a corresponding\
    \ significant loss of activity of most cell identity-associated transcription\
    \ factors. Moreover, by performing integrative analyses of our single-nuclei multi-omics\
    \ data with common genetic variants associated with age at natural menopause (ANM)\
    \ from genome-wide association studies, we demonstrate a global impact of functional\
    \ variants on changes in gene regulatory networks across ovarian cell types. Finally,\
    \ we nominate about a dozen of functional non-coding variants, their target genes\
    \ and cell types and regulatory mechanisms that underlie genetic association with\
    \ ANM. This work provides a comprehensive multimodal landscape of human ovarian\
    \ ageing and mechanistic insights into inherited variation of ANM."
