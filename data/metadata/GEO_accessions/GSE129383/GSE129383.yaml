  "series_summary": "We have studied the impact of T2D on open chromatin in human\
    \ pancreatic islets. We used assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using\
    \ sequencing (ATAC-seq) to profile open chromatin in islets from T2D and non-diabetic\
    \  donors. We identified ATAC-seq peaks representing open chromatin regions  in\
    \ islets of non-diabetic and diabetic donors. The majority of ATAC-seq peaks mapped\
    \ near transcription start sites. Additionally, peaks were enriched in enhancer\
    \ regions and in regions where islet-specific TFs bind. Islet ATAC-seq peaks overlap\
    \ with SNPs associated with T2D and with additional SNPs in LD with known T2D\
    \ SNPs. There was enrichment of open chromatin regions near highly expressed genes\
    \ in human islets."

    sample_growth_protocol_ch1: "Islets were cultured in CMRL 1066 medium supplemented with 10 mM nicotinamide, 10 mM HEPES buffer , 0.25 μg/ml fungizone, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 μg/ml Ciprofloxacin, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated human serum and 5.56 mM glucose. Some islets were frozen at -80 degrees celcius before use and some were used fresh."
    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Islets were washed twice with ice cold 1xPBS by spinning at 500g for 5mins at 4°C. Cell lysis was performed with ATAC lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3mM MgCl2, 10mM NaCl and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630) by incubating on ice for 10mins and nuclei were then collected by spinning at 500g for 10mins at 4°C., The transposition reaction mix (12.5μl of 2X TD buffer, 2μl of Tn5 transposase (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and 10.5μl of nuclease free water was added to nuclei and incubated at 37°C for 1hour before the reaction was cleaned using MinElute cleanup kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Next, 10-12cycles of PCR were performed with transposed DNA using the Illumina Nextera dual index primers. The PCR product was cleaned using PCR purification kit (Qiagen)."
