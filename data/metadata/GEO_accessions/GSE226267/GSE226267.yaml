  "series_summary": "Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a lipid and cholesterol transport\
    \ molecule known to influence Alzheimer''s disease (AD) risk in an isoform-specific\
    \ manner. In particular, the APOE E4 allele is the largest genetic risk factor\
    \ for late-onset sporadic AD. Our recent findings uncovered activated, clonally\
    \ expanded T cells in AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This T cell phenotype occurred\
    \ concomitantly with altered expression of APOE in CSF monocytes. Yet, whether\
    \ APOE variants differentially affect peripheral immunity systems remains unknown.\
    \ In this study, we performed targeted immune profiling using single-cell epigenetic\
    \ and transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We\
    \ analyzed 55 age-matched healthy control (HC) and AD patients with equal distribution\
    \ of APOE E3/E3, E3/E4, and E4/E4 genotypes. We reveal dysregulation in monocytes\
    \ and clonally expanded T cells that are distinct to AD patients carrying the\
    \ APOE E4/E4 genotype. Additionally, we find APOE isoform-dependent chromatin\
    \ accessibility differences that correspond to RNA expression changes. Cumulatively,\
    \ these results uncover APOE isoform-dependent changes to peripheral immunity\
    \ in AD."
