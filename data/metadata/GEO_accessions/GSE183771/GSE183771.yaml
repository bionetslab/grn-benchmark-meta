  "series_summary": "The human menstrual cycle can be divided into two major phases\
    \ by the event of ovulation. Before ovulation, in the proliferative or follicular\
    \ phase, the endometrium proliferates under the influence of estradiol produced\
    \ by growing ovarian follicles. After ovulation, in the secretory or luteal phase,\
    \ ovarian progesterone produced by the newly formed corpus luteum drives a process\
    \ of differentiation during which the endometrium becomes competent to receive\
    \ and support the growth of the embryo. Single-cell analyses at the RNA level\
    \ from our group and others have begun to decipher cell-type specific expression\
    \ in the endometrium. How these events are controlled at the chromatin level remains\
    \ elusive, however. In this study, we applied single-cell assay for transposase-accessible\
    \ chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) to profile the epigenetic landscapes\
    \ of human endometrial samples across the menstrual cycle."

    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Nuclei were extracted according to the 10X Genomics demonstrated protocol for frozen tissue (CG000212 Rev B), modified to include an additional wash with Wash buffer. Tissue homogenization was performed using a dounce homogenizer. Filtered nuclei suspension was  pelleted as instructed and then resuspended in 50 ul Storage Buffer from the EZ nuclei kit (Sigma Aldrich, NUC101). For downstream processing, nuclei were thawed briefly on ice, resuspended with 500 ul Wash Buffer and gently pipetted.  Nuclei were pelleted at 500 × g (5 min, 4 ˚C) then resuspended again in 500 ul Wash Buffer before counting and continuing to Chromium capture., scATAC-seq libraries were generated according to the Chromium Single Cell ATAC protocol (10 × GENOMICS, CG000168) as described previously (Satpathy et al. 2019) and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform."
    sample_data_processing: "Raw base calls from sequencing were processed into FASTQ format using cellranger-atac mkfastq from 10x Genomics Cell Ranger ATAC v1.2.0., The cellranger-atac count pipeline from 10x Genomics Cell Ranger ATAC v1.2 was used for alignment and generation of single-cell chromatin accessibility counts from each cell in the form of a peak-barcode matrix. Filtered peak-barcode matrices, without background and non-cellular barcodes, were used for further analysis."
    supplementary_files_format_and_content: "10X Genomics Cell Ranger ATAC filtered cell barcodes and fragment files in TSV format, filtered peak-barcode count matrices in MTX format, and peak locations in BED format."
