  "series_summary": "The CD8 T cell response features functions that are fundamental\
    \ for long-lasting immune protection, including antigen-specific cytolysis and\
    \ memory. Accordingly, a range of differentiation subsets have been described\
    \ with diverse functionalities and corresponding profiles of expression of markers.\
    \ In both mouse and human systems, a major distinction has been \u201Cmemory\u201D\
    \ versus \u201Ceffector\u201D terms. On the one hand, these terms may relate to\
    \ temporality within the immune response : \u201Ceffector\u201D indicates the\
    \ acute phase, \u201Cmemory\u201D refers to the post-contraction, resting phase.\
    \ On the other hand, the terms also assign prototypic differentiation phenotypes\
    \ that may be found at the same time-point : memory or effector subsets, based\
    \ on characteristic markers. In this study, we analyse the human CD8 T cell response\
    \ to YF-17D vaccination as the best-known model of acute immune response in humans.\
    \ We study 21 characteristic markers conventionally used in mice and in humans\
    \ to analyse and describe differentiation, activation, cycling, and so-called\
    \ effector functions such as cytokine production and degranulation. We find clearly\
    \ distinct \u2018acute traits\u2019 at the peak of the response that are shared\
    \ amongst all non-na\xEFve antigen-specific subsets, including in memory phenotype\
    \ cells. These acute traits were low BCL-2 and high Ki67, CD38, HLA- DR, as well\
    \ as increased Granzyme B and Perforin, which have been previously attributed\
    \ only to effector cells at the peak of the response. Altogether, we evidenced\
    \ \u2018acute traits\u2019 independent of differentiation phenotypes, supporting\
    \ the semantic and marker distinction between \u201Ceffector\u201D and \u201C\
    acute\u201D terms in the human CD8 T cell response."

Wash with buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM NaCl, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20) then wash with Nuclei buffer (10x Genomics), and resuspension in Nuclei buffer (10x Genomics), Loading was setup to target the recovery of 5''000 nuclei. The library preparation was performed using the Chromium Single Cell ATAC kit (v1.0 Chemistry) strictly following the 10X guidelines (CG000168, revB) running 12 cycles for the GEM incubation step (linear amplification) and Â 12 PCR cycles for the sample index PCR step."
    sample_data_processing: "The CellRanger -atac v1.2.0 was used for primary analysis of the scATACseq data., Raw base call (BCL) files were converted to FASTQ files and filtered reads were aligned to the human GRCh38 reference genome., Libraries were merged using CellRanger -atac aggr, Transposase cut sites in each cell were quantified using barcoded UMIs and 10x cell barcode sequences., Count matrix for accessible chromatin peaks was generated for downstream analysis using the R package Signac (v0.2.4)."
