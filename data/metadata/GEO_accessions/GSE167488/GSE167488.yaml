    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "For RNA-seq, total RNA were extracted from tissues using Trizol reagent. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) following manufacturer’s protocol., For ATAC-seq, DNA sample preparation was performed as described in Corces et al., 2017. The Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) was used to perform the transposition reactions according to manufacturer’s instruction."
    sample_data_processing: "Adaptor and low-quality sequences were trimmed from sequenced reads. For RNA-seq, the processed reads were mapped to hg38 genome reference using STAR v2.7.7. For ATAC-seq, the processed reads were also aligned to hg38 genome reference using BWA (v0.7.17-r1188)., For RNA-seq, read counts were generated using HTSeq v0.11.2. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted using DESeq2 R package (v1.26.0). For ATAC-seq, multiply mapped reads were removed using SAMtool v1.9. The bam file generated by the uniquely mapped reads were used for peak calling using MACS2 (v2.1.2) with q-value < 0.05. Differential peak analysis was conducted using DESeq2 R package (v1.26.0). Genomic features of peaks were annotated using ChIPseeker R package (v1.22.1)."
