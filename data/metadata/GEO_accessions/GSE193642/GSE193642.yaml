  "series_summary": "Antibody-secreting cells (ASC) circulate after vaccination and\
    \ infection and migrate to the bone marrow (BM) where a subset known as long-lived\
    \ plasma cells (LLPC) persist and secrete antibodies for a lifetime. The mechanisms\
    \ of how circulating ASC become LLPC is not well elucidated. Here, we show that\
    \ human early-minted blood ASCs have distinct morphology, transcriptomes, and\
    \ epigenetics compared to human BM LLPC. Compared to blood ASC, BM LLPC have decreased\
    \ nucleus/cytoplasm ratio but increased endoplasmic reticulum and numbers of mitochondria.\
    \ Additionally, LLPC acquire transcriptional and epigenetic differences in multiple\
    \ cellular pathways that include apoptosis. Upregulation of the anti-apoptotic\
    \ genes MCL1, BCL2, BCL-XL while simultaneously downregulation of pro-apoptotic\
    \ genes HRK1, CASP3, and CASP8 occurs in LLPC. Consistent with the decrease in\
    \ gene expression, pro-apoptotic gene loci are less accessible in LLPC. In contrast,\
    \ anti-apoptotic gene expression is increased but is not always accompanied by\
    \ changes in accessibility. Importantly, we show that early-minted blood ASCs\
    \ undergo morphological and transcriptional changes that make these cells resemble\
    \ ex vivo BM ASCs, suggesting that the BM microniche at least in part promotes\
    \ LLPC maturation. Overall, our study demonstrates that early-minted blood ASC\
    \ in the BM microniche must undergo morphological, transcriptional, and epigenetic\
    \ changes to mature into apoptotic-resistant LLPC."

    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Cells were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 500xg, and tagmentation was performed by resuspending cells in 25 ul of Tagmentation mix (1X TD buffer (10 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.1, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% DMF), 2.5 μl Tn5 transposase, 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.02% Digitonin) and then incubated for 1 h at 37°C. DNA was purified and amplified into a sequencing library with KAPA HiFi Polymerase and the Nextera Indexing Kit Primers (Illumina, Inc)."
    sample_data_processing: "Raw sequencing reads were mapped to the hg38 version of the human genome using Bowtie., For each sample peaks of accessibility were identified and annotated using MACS2."
