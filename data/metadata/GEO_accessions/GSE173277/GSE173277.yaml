  "series_summary": "ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin followed\
    \ by sequencing) is widely used to decode chromatin accessibility. Here we performed\
    \ high-sensitive ATAC-seq in 9 human liver samples from normal and T2D donors,\
    \ and identified a set of differentially accessible regions (DARs). DARs were\
    \ overlapped with publicly available CREs databases and integrated with multi-omics\
    \ data to identify candidates for further experimental validations. We identified\
    \ 7 DARs that mark putative regulatory elements including a candidate enhancer\
    \ for the ACOT1 gene that regulates the balance of acyl-CoA and free fatty acids\
    \ in the cytoplasm. The relevance of ACOT1 regulation in T2D was supported by\
    \ the analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics data in liver tissue.  Conclusions:\
    \ Our strategy that integrates chromatin accessibility with DNA binding and other\
    \ types of omics provides novel insights towards the role of genetic regulation\
    \ in complex multifactorial diseases such as T2D."
