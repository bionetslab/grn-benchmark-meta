  "series_summary": "Understanding kidney disease relies upon defining the complexity\
    \ of cell types and states, their associated molecular profiles, and interactions\
    \ within tissue neighborhoods. We applied multiple single-cell or -nucleus assays\
    \ (>400,000 nuclei/cells) and spatial imaging technologies to a broad spectrum\
    \ of healthy reference (45 donors) and diseased (48 patients) kidneys. This has\
    \ provided a high resolution cellular atlas of 51 main cell types that include\
    \ rare and novel cell populations. The multi-omic approach provides detailed transcriptomic\
    \ profiles, epigenomic regulatory factors, and spatial localizations spanning\
    \ the entire kidney. We further define 28 cellular states across nephron segments\
    \ and interstitium that were altered in kidney injury, encompassing cycling, adaptive\
    \ or maladaptive repair, transitioning and degenerative states. Molecular signatures\
    \ permitted localization of these states within injury neighborhoods using spatial\
    \ transcriptomics, while large-scale 3D imaging analysis (~1.2 million neighborhoods)\
    \ provided corresponding linkages to active immune responses. These analyses defined\
    \ biological pathways relevant to injury time-course and niches, including signatures\
    \ underlying epithelial repair that predicted maladaptive states associated with\
    \ a decline in kidney function. This integrated multimodal spatial cell atlas\
    \ of healthy and diseased human kidneys represents the most comprehensive benchmark\
    \ of cellular states, neighborhoods, outcome-associated signatures, and publicly\
    \ available interactive visualizations.   "
