  "series_summary": "Open chromatin provides access to DNA binding proteins for the\
    \ correct spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. Mapping chromatin accessibility\
    \ has been widely used to identify the location of cis regulatory elements (CREs)\
    \ including promoters and enhancers. CREs show tissue- and cell-type specificity\
    \ and disease-associated variants are often enriched for CREs in the tissues and\
    \ cells that pertain to a given disease. To better understand the role of CREs\
    \ in neuropsychiatric disorders we applied the Assay for Transposase Accessible\
    \ Chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq) to neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei\
    \ isolated from frozen postmortem human brain by fluorescence-activated nuclear\
    \ sorting (FANS). Most of the identified open chromatin regions (OCRs) are differentially\
    \ accessible between neurons and non-neurons, and show enrichment with known cell\
    \ type markers, promoters and enhancers. Relative to those of non-neurons, neuronal\
    \ OCRs are more evolutionarily conserved and are enriched in distal regulatory\
    \ elements. Transcription factor (TF) footprinting analysis identifies differences\
    \ in the regulome between neuronal and non-neuronal cells and ascribes putative\
    \ functional roles to a number of non-coding schizophrenia (SCZ) risk variants.\
    \ Among the identified variants is a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) proximal\
    \ to the gene encoding SNX19. In vitro experiments reveal that this SNP leads\
    \ to an increase in transcriptional activity. As elevated expression of SNX19\
    \ has been associated with SCZ, our data provides evidence that the identified\
    \ SNP contributes to disease. These results represent the first analysis of OCRs\
    \ and TF binding sites in distinct populations of postmortem human brain cells\
    \ and further our understanding of the regulome and the impact of neuropsychiatric\
    \ disease-associated genetic risk variants."
