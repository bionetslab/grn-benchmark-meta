  "series_summary": "The germinal centre (GC) response is critical for both effective\
    \ adaptive immune responses and establishing peripheral tolerance by limiting\
    \ auto-reactive B cells. To understand the gene regulatory principles underlying\
    \ B cell maturation and the GC response we generated a single-cell transcriptomic\
    \ and epigenomic atlas of the human tonsil, a widely studied, representative lymphoid\
    \ tissue. We identify diverse immune cell subsets to help us map dynamic transcription\
    \ factor activity during B cell activation, GC formation and plasma cell differentiation.\
    \ We subsequently leverage cell type-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic maps\
    \ to interpret the regulatory potential of fine-mapped autoimmune genetic variants.\
    \ This reveals that many autoimmune disease-associated variants exhibit the greatest\
    \ regulatory potential in GC-associated immune cell populations, providing a valuable\
    \ cell-type resolved resource to understanding cellular and genetic causes underpinning\
    \ autoimmune disease."

    # Project metadata:
    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Tonsil samples were collected from children and adults undergoing routine tonsillectomy. All participants provided written informed consent and the protocols were approved by Stanford Universityâ€™s Institutional Review Board. Whole tonsils were collected in saline and processed within four hours of receipt. Tissues were treated with penicillin, streptomycin, and normocin for 30 minutes on ice and heavily clotted or cauterized areas of the tissue were removed. Tonsils were then dissected into small pieces (roughly 5-8 pieces per tonsil) before mechanical dissociation through a 100um cell strainer using a syringe plunger. Mononuclear cells were isolated by ficoll density gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare) and the buffy coats were collected. Cells were cryopreserved in 90% fetal bovine serum, 10% DMSO until use., Libraries were contructed following the 10X scATAC and scRNA protocols"
    sample_data_processing: "BaseCall files were used to generate FASTQ files with either cellranger mkfastq (v3; 10X Genomics) or cellranger-atac (v1; 10X Genomics) prior to running cellranger count with the cellranger-GRCh38-3.0.0 reference or cellranger-atac count the cellranger-atac-GRCh38-1.1.0 reference for scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq libraries respectively."
