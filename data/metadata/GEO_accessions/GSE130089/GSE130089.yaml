  "series_summary": "Genetically-engineered immune cell therapies have been in development\
    \ for decades and recently have proven effective to treat some types of cancer.\
    \ CRISPR-based genome editing methods enabling more flexible and targeted sequence\
    \ integrations than viral transduction have potential to extend the clinical utility\
    \ of cell therapies. Realization of this potential depends on improved knowledge\
    \ of how coding and non-coding sites throughout the genome can be modified efficiently\
    \ and on improved methods to discover novel synthetic DNA sequences that can be\
    \ introduced at targeted sites to enhance critical immune cell functions. Here,\
    \ we developed improved rules for non-viral genome targeting in human T cells\
    \ and a pooled discovery platform to identify synthetic genome modifications that\
    \ enhance therapeutically-relevant cell functions.  We elucidated the breadth\
    \ of targetable genomic loci by performing large knockins at 91 different genomic\
    \ sites in primary human T cells, and demonstrated the power of flexible genome\
    \ targeting by generating cells with Genetically Engineered Endogenous Proteins\
    \ (GEEPs) that seamlessly integrate synthetic and endogenous genetic elements\
    \ to alter signaling input, output, or regulatory control of genes encoding key\
    \ immune receptors. Motivated by success in introducing synthetic circuits into\
    \ endogenous sites, we then developed a platform to facilitate discovery of novel\
    \ multi-gene circuits that reprogram both T cell specificity and function. We\
    \ knocked-in barcoded pools of large DNA sequences encoding poly-cistronic gene\
    \ programs. High-throughput pooled screening of targeted knock-ins to the endogenous\
    \ T cell receptor (TCR) locus revealed a transcriptional regulator and novel protein\
    \ chimeras that combined with a new TCR specificity to enhance T cell responses\
    \ in the presence of suppressive conditions in vitro and in vivo. Overall, these\
    \ pre-clinical studies provide flexible tools to discover complex synthetic gene\
    \ programs that can be written into targeted genome sites to generate more effective\
    \ therapeutic cells."

    sample_treatment_protocol_ch1: "ATAC-seq was performed on cell samples on the day of processing from whole blood, prior to anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, or 48 hours post-processing and stimulation"
    sample_growth_protocol_ch1: "Primary human T cells were isolated from either fresh whole blood from healthy donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood samples by Ficoll centrifugation using SepMate tubes (STEMCELL, per manufacturer’s instructions). T cells were isolated from PBMCs from all cell sources by magnetic negative selection using an EasySep Human T Cell Isolation Kit (STEMCELL, per manufacturer’s instructions). XVivo15 medium (STEMCELL) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 µM N-acetyl L-cystine was used to culture primary human T cells. In preparation for electroporation, T cells were stimulated for 2 days at a starting density of approximately 1 million cells per mL of media with anti-human CD3/CD28 magnetic Dynabeads (ThermoFisher), at a bead to cell ratio of 1:1, and cultured in XVivo15 media containing IL-2 (500 U ml−1; UCSF Pharmacy), IL-7 (5 ng ml−1; ThermoFisher), and IL-15 (5 ng ml−1; Life Tech)."
    sample_data_processing: "ATAC-seq reads trimmed using cutadapt v1.18 to remove Nextera transposase, Reads were aligned to hg19 using Bowtie2 v2.3.4.3., Low-quality reads were removed using samtools v1.9 view function (samtools view -F 1804 -f 2 -q 30 -h -b)., Duplicates were removed using picard v2.18.26, Reads were converted to BED format using bedtools bamtobed function and normalized to reads per million, Reads mapping within 500bp on either side of a CRISPR gRNA cut site for a set of genes of interest were counted using the bedtools intersect function."
