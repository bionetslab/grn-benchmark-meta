  "series_summary": "Background: While bulk and single cell transcriptomic patterns\
    \ in circulating leukocytes from trauma patients have been reported, how these\
    \ relate to changes in open chromatin patterns remain unstudied. Here, we investigated\
    \ whether single-cell ATAC-seq would provide further resolution of transcriptomic\
    \ patterns that align with patient outcomes. + Methods: We performed scATAC-seq\
    \ on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four trauma patients at <4hr, 24hr,\
    \ 72hr post-injury and four matched healthy controls, and extracted the features\
    \ associated with the global epigenetic alterations. Three large-scale bulk transcriptomic\
    \ datasets from trauma, burn and sepsis patients were used to validate the scATAC-seq\
    \ derived signature, explore patient epigenetic heterogeneity (Epigenetic Groups:\
    \ EG_hi vs. EG_lo), and associate patterns with clinical outcomes in critical\
    \ illness.  + Findings: Patient subsets with gene expression patterns in blood\
    \ leukocytes representative of a high global epigenetic signature (EG_hi) had\
    \ worse outcomes across three etiologies of critical illness. EG_hi designation\
    \ contributed independent of the known immune leukocyte transcriptomic responses\
    \ to patient prognosis (Trauma: HR=0.62 [95% CI: 0.43-0.89, event set as recovery],\
    \ p=0.01, n=167; Burns: HR=4.35 [95% CI: 0.816-23.2, event set as death], p=0.085,\
    \ n=121; Sepsis: HR=1.60 [95% CI: 1.10-2.33, event set as death], p=0.013, n=479;\
    \ Cox proportional hazards regression). + Interpretation: The inclusion of gene\
    \ expression patterns that associate with global epigenetic changes in circulating\
    \ leukocytes improves the resolution of transcriptome-based patient classification\
    \ in acute critical illnesses. Early detection of both the global epigenetic signature\
    \ and the known immune transcriptomic patterns associates with the worse prognosis\
    \ in trauma, burns and sepsis."
