  "series_summary": "Genetic risk variants identified in genome-wide association studies\
    \ (GWAS) of complex disease are primarily non-coding, and translating risk variants\
    \ into mechanistic insight requires detailed gene regulatory maps in disease-relevant\
    \ cell types. Here, we combined a GWAS of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in 520,580 samples\
    \ with candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in pancreas and peripheral blood\
    \ mononuclear cell types defined using single nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) of\
    \ 131,554 nuclei. T1D risk variants were enriched in cCREs active in T cells and\
    \ additional cell types, including acinar and ductal cells of the exocrine pancreas.\
    \ Risk variants at multiple T1D signals overlapped exocrine-specific cCREs linked\
    \ to genes with exocrine-specific expression. At the CFTR locus, T1D risk variant\
    \ rs7795896 mapped in a ductal-specific cCRE which regulated CFTR, and the risk\
    \ allele reduced transcription factor binding, enhancer activity and CFTR expression\
    \ in ductal cells. These findings support a role for the exocrine pancreas in\
    \ T1D pathogenesis and highlight the power of large-scale GWAS and single cell\
    \ epigenomics for understanding the cellular origins of complex disease. + "

    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Nuclei were isolated from fresh pancreatic islets using a glass dounce homogenizer with a tight-fitting pestle, frozen whole pancreas using a mortar and pestle, and PBMCs using a lysis buffer., (CB; combinatorial barcoding) Permeabilized nuclei were distributed to 96 wells and tagmentation was carried out to introduce a first barcode combination. After pooling, 20 nuclei were sorted into each well of a 96 well plate and a second barcode was introduced by PCR. Libraries were purified according to the MinElute PCR Purification Kit manual using a vacuum manifold and size selection was performed with SPRI Beads. (10X; 10X Genomics) Libraries were generated using the 10X Genomics Chromium Chip E Single Cell ATAC kit following the manufacturers instructions."
