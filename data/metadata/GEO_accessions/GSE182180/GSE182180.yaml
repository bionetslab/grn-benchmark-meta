  "series_summary": "Background: Growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma (GHPA)\
    \ is an insidious disease with persistent hypersecretion of growth hormone and\
    \ insulin-like growth factor 1, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.\
    \ Though treatments for GHPA have greatly improved, lack of deep knowledge on\
    \ the precise molecular mechanisms involved in GHPA hinders the development of\
    \ therapeutic approaches. Few studies have attempted to reveal the genome-wide\
    \ landscape of GHPA. As chromatin structure change exerts significant influence\
    \ on gene transcription, herein, we investigated the landscape of chromatin accessibility.\
    \ Methods: Both assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput\
    \ sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were applied to identify\
    \ the differential expression genes (DEGs) and uncover chromatin accessibility\
    \ changes and the potentially associated transcription factor (TFs) in somatotropinoma\
    \ tissues. Results: 64 DEGs were obtained, including 10 DEGs were elevated in\
    \ the tumors and 54 DEGs were negligibly expressed in adenomas. A total of 3916\
    \ increased and 2895 decreased chromatin-accessible regions were identified nearby\
    \ these DEGs. The majority of DEGs associated with closed chromatin regions were\
    \ significantly down-regulated in our study, while the most of DEGs near open\
    \ chromatin were not expectantly up-regulated. Additionally, the newly opened\
    \ and closed chromatin regions were highly enriched for GRE and CTCF transcription\
    \ factor binding sites, which were potentially relevant to the regulation of chromatin\
    \ accessibility and genes expression in GHPA. Conclusion: Collectively, our results\
    \ reveal the landscape of chromatin accessibility and unique enhancer in GHPA,\
    \ which may, at least in part, contribute to tumorigenesis and provide a new field\
    \ of drug development."
