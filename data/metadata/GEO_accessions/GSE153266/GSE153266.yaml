  "series_summary": "The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing\
    \ (ATAC-Seq) was applied to investigate the TO-associated chromatin alteration(s)\
    \ appeared in tracheobronchial basal cells (TBBC). ATAC-Seq data was generated\
    \ on cultured TBBCs derived from lesion regions and patient-matched lesion-free\
    \ regions of two patients with Stage I and Stage III disease respectively, in\
    \ parallel with control TBBCs from two normal donors. Six samples were spontaneously\
    \ divided into two main groups (TO and non-TO) based on both differentiation phenotype\
    \ and clustering results. The relationship between chromatin accessibility and\
    \ future gene expression during basal stem cell differentiation was analyzed in\
    \ combination with RNA-Seq. We identified 222914 increased chromatin accessible\
    \ regions whilst 6406 decreased chromatin accessible regions in TO cells compared\
    \ to non-TO cells. Among 641 loci with TO-related increased accessibility at the\
    \ promoter region, 22 were associated with up-regulated gene expression (cutoff\
    \ at fold change>2, p<0.05), and out of which, 18 exhibited enhanced transcriptional\
    \ induction during basal cell differentiation. On the other hand, there were 459\
    \ loci with decreased accessibility at the promoter region in TO, among which,\
    \ 107 were associated with down-regulated expression (cutoff at fold change<-2,\
    \ p<0.05) and 58/107 exhibited transcriptional suppression during differentiation.\
    \ Our study suggests that chromatin remodeling may provide an explanation for\
    \ the sustained basal cell malfunction in TO pathogenesis."

    sample_growth_protocol_ch1: "Tracheobronchial basal cells from normal and TO-derived biopsies were isolated and cloned on a lawn of irradiated 3T3-J2 cells in Stem Culture medium made in house with a combinatorial supplement of trio inhibitors as previously described (Liu et al., 2012; Mou et al., 2016)."
    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Selected 50 average size islets were lysed in lysis buffer.Nuclei were then incubated with the Tn5 transposome and tagmentation., Libaray was prepared according to protocols of TruePrep DNA Library Prep Kit V2 for illumina(Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China) .The libraries were sequenced on HiSeq platform and using PE150 sequencing strategy"
    sample_data_processing: "Raw sequence reads were initially processed by FastQC for quality control, and then adapter sequences and poor quality reads were removed by using Trimmomatic., Quality filtered reads were then mapped to mm10 reference genome using BWA(0.7.10), and only uniquely mapped reads were kept., Sam files were converted to Bam format using Samtools and used for peak calling. MACS2(2.1.1)was used to call peaks and an initial threshold q-value of 0.05 as cutoff., Visualization of read count data was performed by converting raw bam files to bigwig files using IGV tools."
