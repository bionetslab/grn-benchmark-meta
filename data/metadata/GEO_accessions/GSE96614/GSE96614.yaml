  "series_summary": "We analyzed differential methylation (via WGBS) between four\
    \ distinct human brain regions (NAcc-nucleus accumbens, BA9-dorsolateral prefrontal\
    \ cortex, BA24-anterior cingulate cortex, and HC-hippocampus) in both sorted nuclei\
    \ and intact tissues. We isolated neuronal and non-neuronal (glial) nuclei from\
    \ the same six individuals for each tissue via FACS using the neuronal marker,\
    \ NeuN. Additionally, we performed WGBS from non-sorted tissues from these same\
    \ brain regions in a total of 12 individuals (BA9 n 9; BA24 n 5; HC n 6; NAcc\
    \ n 7). To complement our DNA methylation analyses, we measured gene expression\
    \ (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) in neuronal and non-neuronal\
    \ nuclei from the nucleus accumbens and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from six\
    \ more individuals. We then performed an integrative analysis to understand how\
    \ the epigenome contributes to brain region-specific function."
