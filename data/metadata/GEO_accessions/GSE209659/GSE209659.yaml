  "series_summary": "Defects in cilia genes that is critical in cilia formation and\
    \ function can cause complicated ciliopathy syndromes involving multiple organs\
    \ and tissues; however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of cilia gene networks\
    \ in ciliopathy are largely unknown. Here, we define the genome-wide redistribution\
    \ of chromatin accessibilities and extensive divergence of cilia genes expression\
    \ programs happened in ciliopathy. Mechanistically, the distinct ciliopathy-activated\
    \ accessible regions (CAAs) are characterized to positively regulate robust changes\
    \ of flanking cilia genes, which are a key transcriptional feature of cilia required\
    \ for the response to developmental signals. Moreover, the single transcriptional\
    \ factors, ETS1, can be recruited to CAAs thus prominently reconstructing chromatin\
    \ accessibility in ciliopathy. CAAs collapse driven by ETS1 suppression subsequently\
    \ cause defective cilia formation and impaired developmental signal transduction,\
    \ which eventually develops ciliopathy phenotypes of short fins and pericardium\
    \ edema in larval fishes. Therefore, our results depicted a dynamic landscape\
    \ of chromatin accessibility in ciliopathy, and uncover an insightful role of\
    \ ETS1 in controlling global cilia genes transcriptional program by reprogramming\
    \ widespread chromatin state."

    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Fresh cells were harvested and resuspended with cold lysis buffer for 10 min on ice. 50,000 nuclei were counted using trypan blue staining and prepared for transposition reactions according to TruePrep DNA Library Prep Kit V2 for illumine (Vazyme, TD501) manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, nuclei were pelleted and resuspended with transposase at 37 °C for 30 min. After transposition, DNA fragments were purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63882)., DNA libraries were constructed after 8 cycles of PCR amplification using the TruePrep DNA Library Prep Kit and sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq-PE150 platform to a depth of 4.0 × 107 reads."
    sample_data_processing: "For ATAC-Seq data processing, FastQC (version 0.11.7) was used to evaluate the quality of the sequencing data, and Trimmomatic was explored to remove the adaptor sequences to obtain the clean data., The clean data were subsequently aligned to the hg38 reference genome using BWA., Multiply mapped reads were removed using SAMtools (version 1.3.1) and the MASCS2 was applied to call significant peaks with q-value < 0.05., To identify DEGs between healthy donor and ciliopathy patients, the ATAC-seq peaks of each sample were merged to generate a consensus set of unique peaks, among which the number of peaks was further counted for each sample using bedtools v2.25.0, and CAAs and CIAs were identified by DESeq2 (v1.16.0)(50),with the thresholds of | log2FC| > 1 and p < 0.05., Genomic features of peaks were annotated using ChIPseeker R package."
