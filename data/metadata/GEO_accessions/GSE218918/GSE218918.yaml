    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "The library was constructed using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell ATAC Library & Gel Bead Kit v1.1. The experimental process was conducted according to manufacturer''s instruction without modification. The final libraries were sequenced on DNBSEQ-G400., single nucleus ATAC sequencing"
    sample_data_processing: "Fastq files were generated using splitBarcode (v0.1.6 from MGI), The sequenced reads were aligned using cellranger-atac count (v1.2.0) to cellranger-atac reference GRCh38 (v 1.2.0)."
