  "series_summary": "Adaptive features of natural killer (NK) cells have been reported\
    \ in various species with different underlying mechanisms. It is unclear, however,\
    \ which NK cell populations are capable of mounting antigen-specific recall responses,\
    \ and how such functions are regulated at the molecular level. Here we identify\
    \ and characterize a discrete population of CD49a+CD16- NK cells in the human\
    \ liver that display increased epigenetic potential to elicit memory responses\
    \ and has the functional properties to exert antigen-specific immunity on the\
    \ skin as an effector site. Integrated chromatin-based epigenetic and transcriptomic\
    \ profiling revealed unique characteristics of hepatic CD49a+CD16- NK cells when\
    \ compared to conventional CD49a-CD16+ NK cells thereby defining active genomic\
    \ regions and molecules underpinning distinct NK cell reactivity. In contrast\
    \ to conventional NK cells, our results suggest adaptive CD49a+CD16- NK cells\
    \ to be able to bypass the KIR receptor-ligand system upon antigen-specific stimulation.\
    \ Furthermore, these cells were highly migratory towards chemokine gradients expressed\
    \ in epicutaneous patch test lesions as an effector site of adaptive immune responses\
    \ of the skin. These results define pathways operative in human antigen-specific\
    \ memory NK cells and provide a roadmap for harnessing this NK cell subset for\
    \ specific therapeutic or prophylactic vaccine strategies."
