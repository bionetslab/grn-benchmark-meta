!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The isolation of nuclei was accomplished using the OmniATAC protocol (Corces*, Granja* et al. Science 362, 2018). Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The isolation of nuclei was accomplished using the OmniATAC protocol (Corces*, Granja* et al. Science 362, 2018). Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The isolation of nuclei was accomplished using the OmniATAC protocol (Corces*, Granja* et al. Science 362, 2018). Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The isolation of nuclei was accomplished using the OmniATAC protocol (Corces*, Granja* et al. Science 362, 2018). Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The isolation of nuclei was accomplished using the OmniATAC protocol (Corces*, Granja* et al. Science 362, 2018). Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The isolation of nuclei was accomplished using the OmniATAC protocol (Corces*, Granja* et al. Science 362, 2018). Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The isolation of nuclei was accomplished using the OmniATAC protocol (Corces*, Granja* et al. Science 362, 2018). Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The isolation of nuclei was accomplished using the OmniATAC protocol (Corces*, Granja* et al. Science 362, 2018). Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The isolation of nuclei was accomplished using the OmniATAC protocol (Corces*, Granja* et al. Science 362, 2018). Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The isolation of nuclei was accomplished using the OmniATAC protocol (Corces*, Granja* et al. Science 362, 2018). Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The isolation of nuclei was accomplished using the OmniATAC protocol (Corces*, Granja* et al. Science 362, 2018). Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The isolation of nuclei was accomplished using the OmniATAC protocol (Corces*, Granja* et al. Science 362, 2018). Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = The isolation of nuclei was accomplished using the OmniATAC protocol (Corces*, Granja* et al. Science 362, 2018). Dissociation of nuclei was carried out entirely on wet ice. 40-60mg of flash-frozen tissue was placed into 2ml dounce tissue grinders containing 1ml HB (Lysis) Buffer (1.0341x HB Stable solution, 1M DTT, 500 mM Spermidine, 150mM Spermine, 10% NP40, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor, Ribolock), gently triturated, then allowed to thaw for 5 minutes in the solution. After 5 minutes, tissue was dounced 10 times with pestle A and 20 times with pestle B, or until there was no resistance from either pestle. Sample was filtered through a 40um cell strainer (Falcon; 352340) and resulting homogenate transferred to a pre-chilled 2ml LoBind tube. Samples were spun in a 4°C fixed angle centrifuge for 5 minutes at 350 RCF to pellet nuclei. After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.

After spinning, all but 50ul of supernatant was removed. 350ul HB was added to the nuclei pellet for a total volume of 400ul. Nuclei were gently resuspended with a wide bore pipet. One volume of 50% Iodixanol (60% OptiPrep [Sigma Aldrich; D1556], Diluent Buffer [2M KCl, 1M MgCl2, 0.75M Tricine-KOH pH 7.8], Water) was added and gently triturated. Next, 600ul of 30% Iodixanol was carefully layered under the 25% mixture. Finally, 600ul of 40% Iodixanol was layered under the 30% mixture. Sample was then spun in a 4°C swinging bucket centrifuge for 20 min at 3,000 RCF. Upon completion of the spin, a band of nuclei was visible. Supernatant was aspirated down to within 200-300ul of the nuclei band. The nuclei band was then collected at 200ul and transferred to a fresh 1.5ml tube. Sample was diluted with one volume (200ul) Resuspension Buffer (1x PBS, 1% BSA, 0.2u/uL Ribolock). Nuclei concentration was determined using the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher; AMQAF1000). In addition to isolating nuclei with the omni-ATAC dounce method, we used the Singulator from S2 Genomics to isolate nuclei for 4 samples (2 normal and 2 polyp) from patient A002. The same buffers (lysis, wash, resuspension) were used for both the manual omni-ATAC dounce and S2 Singulator methods. HB buffer was prepared following the OmniATAC protocol, with the addition of 15ul Ribolock per 1mL HB buffer to help maintain RNA integrity. Approximately 50-70mg tissue in small chunks were placed into the Nuclei Isolation Cartridge. We ran the Extended Nuclei Isolation Singulator program which includes disruption, 5 minute incubation, disruption, filtration (150um and 40um filters) and buffer rinse of the cartridge. Following dissociation, nuclei were spun at 300g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and nuclei were resuspended in Resuspension Buffer (noted above). Nuclei were counted using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher). The total dissociation time for 4 samples was approximately 1 hour, as one sample can be run at a time on the S2 Singulator.
