  "series_summary": "Induction of trained immunity by human Bacille-Calmette-Gu\xE9\
    rin (BCG) vaccination is implicated in the beneficial heterologous effects of\
    \ the vaccine, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We performed global\
    \ transcriptome analysis of sorted progenitors from bone marrow before (D0) and\
    \ 90 days after vaccination (D90). BCG vaccination induced transcriptomic myeloid\
    \ priming of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment marked\
    \ by the upregulation of myeloid and granulocytic pathways alongside the induction\
    \ of transcription factors connected to myeloid cell function, namely Hepatocyte\
    \ Nuclear Factors (HNF). These findings are corroborated by higher granulocyte\
    \ numbers in BCG-vaccinated infants, HNF1-related SNP variants correlating with\
    \ immune training and elevated serum levels of the HNF1 target gene SERPINA1.\
    \ Taken together, we reveal a transcriptomic reprograming of HSPCs and peripheral\
    \ monocytes as a trait of in vivo BCG-induced trained immunity."

    # Project metadata:
    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Samples for ATAC-seq analysis were prepared from CD14+-MACS-enriched monocytes from fresh PBMCs (Pan Monocyte Isolation Kit, Miltenyi Biotec). 50,000 cells were washed in cold PBS and resuspended in cold lysis buffer (10 mM NaCL, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1 % IGEPAL, 10mM Tris-HCl pH7.4)., After centrifugation, pellets were incubated in primer-loaded transposase Tn5 in reaction buffer (10 mM TAPS-NaOH (pH 8.5) at 25°C, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% DMF) for 30 min at 37ºC. Samples were subsequently immediately purified using the MinElute kit (Qiagen GmbH) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines, eluted in 10 µl H2O and stored at -20 ºC until further processing."
    sample_data_processing: "raw data was converted and multiplexed using bcl2fastq2 (v2.20)., reads were aligned to human hg19 index with bowtie1 (v1.1.1)., duplicates were filtered by applying the Picard (v1.134) tool., removal of adapter offset and creation of bam files was done with samtools., open chromatin peaks were called using MACS2  (v2.1.0.20140616)., blacklisted regions (ENCFF001TDO_hg19_blacklist.bed.gz) were excluded., peaks were annotated using HOMER (applying annotatePeaks.pl). Downstream analysis was performed within the DESeq2 (v1.20.0) package environment."
    supplementary_files_format_and_content: "filtered data was imported into the DESeq2 package (v1.20.0) in R to generated a normalized expression table. CSV file includes normalised peak count table."
