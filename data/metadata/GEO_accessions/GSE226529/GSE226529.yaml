  "series_summary": "Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq)\
    \ provides an accurate way to depict the chromatin regulatory state and altered\
    \ mechanisms guiding gene expression in disease. However bulk sequencing entangles\
    \ information from different cell types and obscures cellular heterogeneity. Here,\
    \ we develop and validate Cellformer, a novel deep learning method, that deconvolutes\
    \ bulk ATAC-seq into cell type-specific expression across the whole genome. Cellformer\
    \ enhances the bulk ATAC-seq resolution and allows an efficient cell type specific\
    \ open chromatin profiling on large size cohorts at a low cost. Applied to 191\
    \ bulk samples from 3 brain regions, Cellformer identifies cell type-specific\
    \ gene regulatory mechanisms and putative mediators involved in resilient to Alzheimer\u2019\
    s disease (RAD), an uncommon group of cognitively healthy individuals that harbor\
    \ a high pathological load of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Cell type-resolved\
    \ chromatin profiling unveils cell type specific pathways and nominates potential\
    \ epigenetic mediators underlying RAD that may illuminate therapeutic opportunities\
    \ to limit the cognitive impact of this highly prevalent yet incurable disease.\
    \ Cellformer has been made freely and publicly available to advance analysis of\
    \ high-throughput bulk ATAC-seq in future investigations."

    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Nuclei were isolated from frozen tissue in accordance with protocol dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.6t8herw. After isolation, nuclei were cryopreserved in BAM Banker (Wako Chemicals) and stored at -80Â°C for use in other assays such as scATAC-seq and HiChIP., Transposed fragments were purified and amplified as described previously (Buenrostro et al., Nature Methods 2015) with slight modification. Briefly, transposed fragments were pre-amplified for 3 cycles. Concentration of pre-amplified fragments was determined by qPCR and this concentration was used to estimate the total number of cycles required to obtain 160 femtomoles of fragments. A second PCR was performed to amplify the pre-amplified fragments for the desired number of cycles. Final libraries were again purified. Prior to sequencing, libraries were pooled and run on a 6% PAGE gel and excess primers and primer dimers below 125 bp were removed."
    sample_data_processing: "The count normalized peak matrix was derived using featureCount."
