  "series_summary": "TNF plays a key role in inflammation and bone resorption. However,\
    \ the mechanisms regulating TNF-mediated osteoclastogenesis remain largely unclear\
    \ because its direct osteoclastogenic ability is weak. Here, we found that TGF\u03B2\
    \ priming enables TNF to effectively induce osteoclastogenesis from macrophages,\
    \ independently of the osteoclastogenic action of RANKL. Lack of TGF\u03B2 signaling\
    \ in macrophages suppresses inflammatory, but not physiological, osteoclastogenesis\
    \ and bone resorption in vivo. Mechanistically, TGF\u03B2 priming reprograms macrophage\
    \ response to TNF towards osteoclastogenesis by remodeling chromatin accessibility\
    \ and histone modification. TGF\u03B2 and TNF induce an unconventional osteoclastogenic\
    \ program, which includes the suppression of the TNF-induced IRF1-IFN\u03B2-IFN\
    \ stimulated gene (ISG) axis, promotion of IRF8 degradation and B-Myb induction.\
    \ These mechanisms are present in RA, in which TGF\u03B2 level is elevated and\
    \ correlated with osteoclast activity. Our findings identify a function and mechanism\
    \ of action for TGF\u03B2 in TNF-mediated inflammatory osteoclastogenesis, and\
    \ open avenues for selective treatment of inflammatory bone loss."

    sample_treatment_protocol_ch1: "CD14+ cells cultured in M-CSF (20ng/ml)  with or without TGFb (10 ng/ml) for 3 days and then stimulated with TNFa (40 ng/ml) for 24hrs."
    sample_growth_protocol_ch1: "Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from the blood of healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll  and a protocol approved by the Hospital for Special Surgery Institutional Review Board. CD14+ human monocytes were purified from PBMCs by positive selection using anti-CD14 magnetic beads as recommended by the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotec). Monocytes were cultured in MEMa (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated defined FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, L-glutamine, and 20 ng/mL human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) with or without TGFb(10 ng/mL)."
    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 500g, 4Â°C., Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (Omni-ATAC-seq) protocol developed by (Corces et al., 2017); single end protocol."
    sample_data_processing: "Sequenced reads were mapped to reference human genome (hg38 assembly) using Bowtie2  with default parameters., MACS2 to identify peaks of ATAC-seq enrichment over background."
