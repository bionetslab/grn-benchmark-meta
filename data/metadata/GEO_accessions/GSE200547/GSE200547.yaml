  "series_summary": "More than 800 million people suffer from kidney disease, yet\
    \ the mechanism of kidney dysfunction is poorly understood. Here we comprehensively\
    \ characterize genetic associations for kidney function (n\u2009=\u20091,508,659\
    \ individuals), DNA methylation (n\u2009=\u2009443 individuals) and gene expression\
    \ (n\u2009=\u2009686 individuals). We identify 878 (126 novel) kidney function\
    \ associated GWAS loci and prioritize target genes for 87% of these loci using\
    \ a multi-stage prioritization strategy. Heritability analysis reveal that methylation\
    \ variation explains a larger fraction of GWAS heritability than gene expression.\
    \ Integration of GWAS and single cell open chromatin (n 57,229 cells) highlights\
    \ the key role of proximal tubules and metabolism in kidney function regulation.\
    \ Further, the causal role of SLC47A1 in kidney disease is defined in mice with\
    \ genetic loss of Slc47a1 and in human individuals carrying loss-of-function variants.\
    \ Our findings emphasize the key role of bulk and single-cell epigenomic information\
    \ in translating genome-wide association studies into identifying causal genes,\
    \ cellular origins and mechanisms of complex traits."

    sample_growth_protocol_ch1: "Human kidney samples were obtained from the non-tumor tissue of partial or radical nephrectomy patients from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania"
    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Kidneys were minced and lysed in 2 mL lysis buffer for 15 min. Tissue lysis reaction was then blocked by adding 10 mL 1x PBS into each tube, and solution was passed through a 40 μm cell strainer. Cell debris and cytoplasmic contaminants were removed by Nuclei PURE Prep Nuclei Isolation Kit (Sigma, NUC-201) after centrifugation at 13,000 RPM for 45 min.  Libraries were prepared according to 10x Genomics''s instructions (CG000209) accompanying the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell ATAC Reagent Kits v1.1.  Single nuclei ATAC-seq, Single nucleus ATAC-seq libraries were generated using the Chromium Single Cell ATAC Library & Gel Bead Kit according to manufacturer’s manual."
