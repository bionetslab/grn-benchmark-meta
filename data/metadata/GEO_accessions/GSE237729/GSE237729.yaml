  "series_summary": "T cell dysfunction occurs early following HIV infection, impacting\
    \ the emergence of non-AIDS morbidities and limiting curative efforts. ART initiated\
    \ during primary HIV infection (PHI) can reverse this dysfunction, but the extent\
    \ of recovery is unknown. We studied 66 HIV-infected individuals treated from\
    \ early PHI with up to three years of ART. Compared with HIV-uninfected controls,\
    \ CD4 and CD8 T cells from early HIV infection were characterised by T cell activation\
    \ and increased expression of the immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs) PD1, Tim-3\
    \ and TIGIT. Three years of ART lead to partial \u2013 but not complete \u2013\
    \ normalisation of ICR expression, the dynamics of which varied for individual\
    \ ICRs. For HIV-specific cells, epigenetic profiling of tetramer-sorted CD8 T\
    \ cells revealed that epigenetic features of exhaustion typically seen in chronic\
    \ HIV infection were already present early in PHI, and that ART initiation during\
    \ PHI resulted in only a partial shift of the epigenome to one with more favourable\
    \ memory characteristics. These findings suggest that although ART initiation\
    \ during PHI results in significant immune reconstitution, there may be only partial\
    \ resolution of HIV-related phenotypic and epigenetic changes."

    sample_data_processing: "bcl2fastq (v2.19.1.403) was used to demultiplex raw data from NextSeq 500 machine., Quality trimming and primer removal in raw fastq files were done with Trimmomatric (v.0.36) using the following parameters: LEADING:15 TRAILING:15 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36., Trimmed reads were aligned to hg19 with Bowtie2 (v.2.2.9) using a maximum insert size of 1,000., Aligned bams were sorted, duplicates marked (Picard v.2.8.0) , and reads mapping to the blacklist region removed., Peak-calling using MACS (v.2.1.1) was performed on merged bam files (Samtools v. 1.3) from biological replicates using a q-value threshold of 0.001. Consensus peaks from all biological conditions were merged to create a single peak universe. Cut sites were extracted from each biological replicate and the number of cuts in each peak region was quantified to generate a raw counts matrix., Normalization and differential expression were performed using DESeq2 (v 1.26.0)"
