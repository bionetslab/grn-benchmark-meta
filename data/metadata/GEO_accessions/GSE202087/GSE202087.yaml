  "series_summary": "We have performed ATAC-seq from FACS sorted immune cell populations\
    \ from peripheral blood of human donors. All donors have a diagnosis of multiple\
    \ sclerosis and some donors were treated with immunotherapy (glatiramer acetate,\
    \ interferon beta, or natalizumab). We called peaks from the ATAC-seq data and\
    \ tested for enrichment of open chromatin regions for each cell population in\
    \ MS GWAS."

    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Cells were flow-sorted directly into cold tagmentation buffer (10 uL TD, 2 uL 2% IGEPAL CA-630, 6 uL nuclease-free H2O, 2 uL TDE1 per sample), followed by incubation at 37℃ for 30 min with shaking at 500 RPM. DNA was extracted QIAGEN MinElute PCR purification kit according to the manufacturer''s protocol, Samples were amplified with KAPA HiFi kits and Illumina Nextera indices. The amplified material was cleaned with the QIAGEN MinElute PCR purification kit and quantified using KAPA library quantification kits"
    sample_data_processing: "Paired-end raw ATAC-seq reads were trimmed using Ngmerge using default parameters, The reads were then aligned to GRCh38 using Bowtie2 version 2.3.5, The resulting SAM files were converted and sorted into BAM format using samtools version 1.5, Reads with MAPQ<10 and reads that were aligned to mitochondria were filtered out using samtools, duplicate reads were removed using picard version 2.20.6, peaks were called using MACS2 version 2.2.5 51 with default parameters and --keep-dup all --nomodel –nolambda"
