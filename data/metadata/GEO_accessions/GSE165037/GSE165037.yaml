  "series_summary": "Intra-tumoral heterogeneity is a key contributor to therapeutic\
    \ failure in glioblastomas, the most common form of primary adult brain cancer.\
    \  To better define this heterogeneity, genome-wide chromatin accessibility and\
    \ transcription profiles of clinical glioblastoma specimens were analyzed at single\
    \ cell resolution. These profiles afforded resolution of intra-tumoral genetic\
    \ heterogeneity and delineation of sub-populations characterized by focal DNA\
    \ amplifications including extrachromosomal circular DNA (ecDNA) that harbor highly\
    \ transcribed oncogenes. The maps of open chromatin helped define cellular states\
    \ of distinct tumor cell populations characterized by unique regulatory landscapes.\
    \ Unexpectedly, the diverse tumor cellular states share a common regulatory program\
    \ involving the Nuclear Factor 1 transcription factors (NFIA and NFIB). Silencing\
    \ of these genes suppressed glioblastoma growth in vitro and in vivo. These results\
    \ demonstrate opportunities for glioblastoma therapeutic discovery through integration\
    \ of single nuclear profiling platforms."

    sample_data_processing: "Reads from snRNA-seq were mapped to the hg38 genome using STAR. Clustering analysis was performed using Seurat V3 on cells that had greater than 200 reads and less than 5% mitochondrial reads., Read from snATAC-seq were mapped to the hg38 genome using bowtie2. Snaptools was used to generate binary count matrices in 5kb genomic bins. Clustering analysis was performed using SnapATAC for cells with greater than 1000 reads and percentage of reads in promoters greater than 20%."
