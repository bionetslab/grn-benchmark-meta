  "series_summary": "Human adult spermatogenesis involves a balance of spermatogonial\
    \ stem cell self renewal and differentiation, alongside complex germline-niche\
    \ interactions. To better understand, we performed single cell RNA sequencing\
    \ of ~7000 testis cells from three healthy men of peak reproductive age. Our analyses\
    \ revealed multiple distinctive transcriptional \u2018states\u2019 of self-renewing\
    \ and differentiating spermatogonia, the cellular stages of gametogenesis, five\
    \ niche cells (Leydig, Myoid, Sertoli, Endothelial, macrophage) and insights into\
    \ germline-niche communication. Spermatogenesis was reconstructed computationally,\
    \ which identified sequential coding, noncoding, and repeat-element transcriptional\
    \ signatures. A new, developmentally early and likely quiescent spermatogonial\
    \ state is identified (GFRA1-/ETV5-/ID4+/UTF1+/FGFR3+). Notably, certain epigenetic\
    \ features combined with nascent transcription analyses suggest considerable plasticity\
    \ within certain spermatogonial populations/states. Key findings were validated\
    \ via RNA and protein staining. Taken together, we provided the first \u201CCell\
    \ Atlas\u201D of the adult human testis, and provide multiple new insights into\
    \ germ cell development and germ cell \u2013 niche interaction."

    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Collected cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2 and 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630) and the nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in Transposase buffer. The Tn5 enzyme was made in house and the transposition reaction was carried out for 30 minutes at 37°C., Following purification, the Nextera libraries were amplified for 12 cycles using the NEBnext PCR master mix and purified using the Qiagen PCR cleanup kit. All libraries were sequenced on a 125-cycle paired-end run on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument."
    sample_data_processing: "Raw ATAC-seq reads were aligned to the hg19 genome using Novoalign (v2.8, Novocraft) using the following options: -o Sam -r Random., Sam files were then combined due to high correlation between technical and biological replicates., Peak calling was performed using callpeak application (v2.1.1.20160309, macs2) using the following parameters: -g 2.7e9 --call-summit –f BAMPE –nomodel –B –SPMR –extsize 200"
