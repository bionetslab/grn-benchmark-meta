  "series_summary": "The Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin by sequencing\
    \ (ATAC-seq) is becoming increasing popular in the neuroscience field where chromatin\
    \ regulation is thought to be involved in neurodevelopment, activity-dependent\
    \ gene regulation, hormonal and environmental responses, and pathophysiology of\
    \ neuropsychiatric disorders. The advantages of using this assay include a small\
    \ amount of material needed, relatively simple and fast protocol, and the ability\
    \ to capture a range of gene regulatory elements with a single assay. However,\
    \ with increasing interest in chromatin research, it is an imperative to have\
    \ feasible, reliable assays that are compatible with a range of neuroscience study\
    \ designs in both animals and humans. Here we tested three different protocols\
    \ for neuronal chromatin accessibility analysis, including a varying brain tissue\
    \ freezing method followed by fluorescent-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) and\
    \ the ATAC-seq analysis. Our study shows that the cryopreservation method impacts\
    \ the number of open chromatin regions that can be identified from frozen brain\
    \ tissue using the cell-type specific ATAC-seq assay. However, we show that all\
    \ three protocols generate consistent and robust data and enable the identification\
    \ of functional regulatory elements, promoters and enhancers, in neuronal cells.\
    \ Our study also implies that the broad biological interpretation of chromatin\
    \ accessibility data is not significantly affected by the freezing condition.\
    \ In comparison to the mouse brain analysis, we reveal the additional challenges\
    \ of doing chromatin analysis on postmortem human brain tissue. However, we also\
    \ show that these studies are revealing important cell type-specific information\
    \ about gene regulation in the human brain. Overall, the ATAC-seq coupled with\
    \ FANS is a powerful method to capture cell-type specific chromatin accessibility\
    \ information in the mouse and human brain. Our study provides alternative brain\
    \ preservation methods that generate high quality ATAC-seq data while fitting\
    \ in different study designs, and further encourages the use of this method to\
    \ uncover the role of epigenetic (dys)regulation in healthy and malfunctioning\
    \ brain."

    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "100 mg of pulverized anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) tissue was obtained from the NIMH Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC). Total nuclei were  extracted from frozen brain tissue using sucrose gradient centrifugation. Neuronal (NeuN+) and non-neuronal nuclei (NeuN-) were isolated with fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting  using an anti-NeuN antibody conjugated to AlexaFluor-488 on a FACSAria instrument. For a detailed protocol for nuclei isolation, see Kundakovic et al, 2017, ATAC-seq libraries were prepared according to Buenrostro et al. 2013 (PMID:24097267) with some modifications. Illumina Nextera DNA Library Prep kit (FC-121-1030) and Nextera Index kit (FC 121-1011) were used to prepare the libraries."
    sample_data_processing: "The obtained sequences were adapter trimmed and aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10 including small contigs) using the BWA-MEM software (arXiv:1303.3997v1)., We selected and used only uniquely aligned reads for the analysis. Reads aligned to mitochondrial DNA and PCR duplicate reads were eliminated from further analysis., Peak calling was performed using the MACS2 peak-calling software."
