  "series_summary": "The epigenome of human brain cells encompasses key information\
    \ in understanding brain function in both healthy and diseased states. To further\
    \ explore this, we used ATAC-seq to profile chromatin structure in four distinct\
    \ populations of cells (glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, oligodendrocytes,\
    \ and microglia/astrocytes), from three different regions of the brain. Chromatin\
    \ accessibility was found to vary vastly by cell type and, more moderately, by\
    \ brain region, with glutamatergic neurons showing the greatest regional variability.\
    \ Transcription factor footprinting pointed to cell-specific transcriptional regulators\
    \ and inferred cell-specific regulation of protein coding genes, long intergenic\
    \ noncoding RNAs, and microRNAs. In vivo transgenic mouse experiments validated\
    \ the cell type specificity of a number of human-derived regulatory sequences.\
    \ Open chromatin regions in glutamatergic neurons were enriched for neuropsychiatric\
    \ risk variants, particularly those associated with schizophrenia. Combining differential\
    \ chromatin accessibility analysis using ATAC-seq data from bulk tissue increased\
    \ our statistical power to confirm glutamatergic neurons as the cell type most\
    \ affected in schizophrenia. Jointly, these findings illustrate the utility of\
    \ studying the cell type specific epigenome in complex tissues such as the human\
    \ brain and implicate an association among chromatin accessibility in glutamatergic\
    \ neurons and genetic risk for schizophrenia."

    sample_data_processing: "Reads from each sample were aligned on gender specific hg19 reference genome (pseudoautosomal region was masked on the chromosome Y for males) using the STAR aligner (v2.5.0) with the following parameters: --alignIntronMax 1, --outFilterMismatchNmax 100, --alignEndsType EndToEnd, --outFilterScoreMinOverLread 0.3, --outFilterMatchNminOverLread 0.3. For each sample, this produced a coordinate-sorted BAM file of mapped paired-end reads. We excluded reads that: (1) mapped to more than one locus; (2) were duplicated; and (3) mapped to the mitochondrial genome. For each sample, this produced a coordinate-sorted BAM file of mapped paired-end reads."
