  "series_summary": "Although the Hi-C maps in cultured immune cell has been reported,\
    \ there still lacks 3D landscape of human primary monocytes. The peripheral blood\
    \ from two health people and two SLE patients was collected and CD14+ monocytes\
    \ were selected to perform Hi-C, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq. The raw data\
    \ of THP1 cell Hi-C library was also used in comparison. We firstly presented\
    \ the 3D genome structure heterogeneity in human primary monocytes. Significantly\
    \ diversity of chromatin interaction in HLA complex region might regulates many\
    \ immunologic processes. The chromatin loop regulation around CD16 and its relevant\
    \ expression pattern indicated the CD16 associated monocyte functions are dominated\
    \ regulated by this variable TAD boundary."

    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Nuclear extracts from about one million cells and chromatin was sheared to an average size of 200 bp with asonicator (Bioruptor Pico, Diagenode)., ChIP libraries were prepared using standard Illumina protocols."
    sample_data_processing: "reads were quality-filtered according to the Illumina pipeline. The data was aligned to the human reference genome (ucsc.hg19) by bowtie2 (version 2.2.3) and binding sites were identified by MACS2 (version 2.1.1)."
