  "series_summary": "SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers profound and variable immune responses\
    \ in human hosts. Chromatin remodeling has been observed in individuals severely\
    \ ill or convalescing with COVID-19, but chromatin remodeling early in disease\
    \ prior to anti-spike protein IgG seroconversion has not been defined. We performed\
    \ the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and\
    \ RNA-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from outpatients with\
    \ mild or moderate symptom severity at different stages of clinical illness. Early\
    \ in the disease course prior to IgG seroconversion, modifications in chromatin\
    \ accessibility associated with mild or moderate symptoms were already robust\
    \ and included severity-associated changes in accessibility of genes in interleukin\
    \ signaling, regulation of cell differentiation and cell morphology. Furthermore,\
    \ single-cell analyses revealed evolution of the chromatin accessibility landscape\
    \ and transcription factor motif accessibility for individual PBMC cell types\
    \ over time. The most extensive remodeling occurred in CD14+ monocytes, where\
    \ sub-populations with distinct chromatin accessibility profiles were observed\
    \ prior to seroconversion. Mild symptom severity was marked by upregulation classical\
    \ antiviral pathways, including those regulating IRF1 and IRF7, whereas in moderate\
    \ disease, these classical antiviral signals diminished, suggesting dysregulated\
    \ and less effective responses. Together, these observations offer novel insight\
    \ into the epigenome of early mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that detection\
    \ of chromatin remodeling in early disease may offer promise for a new class of\
    \ diagnostic tools for COVID-19."

    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "PBMCs were thawed and nuclei were extracted as for ATAC-seq. The single-cell suspensions of scATAC-seq samples were converted to barcoded scATAC-seq libraries using the Chromium Single Cell 5′ Library, Gel Bead and Multiplex Kit, and Chip Kit (10x Genomics)., The Chromium Single Cell 5′ v2 Reagent (10x Genomics, 120237) kit was used to prepare single-cell ATAC libraries according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality was assessed using Agilent DNA tape screen assay."
    sample_data_processing: "Sequencing data were used as input to the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger ATAC pipeline to demultiplex BCL files, generate FASTQs, and generate feature counts for each library., For scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq integration, fragment file outputs generated using CellRanger ATAC count were analyzed using ArchR following the standard workflow and with default parameters unless otherwise specified., Cells with a transcription start site enrichment score < 4, cells with fewer than 1000 detected fragments, and putative doublets were removed from downstream analysis."
