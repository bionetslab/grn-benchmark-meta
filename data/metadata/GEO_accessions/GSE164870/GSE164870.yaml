  "series_summary": "Identifying the molecular mechanisms by which genome-wide association\
    \ study (GWAS) loci influence traits remains challenging. Chromatin accessibility\
    \ quantitative trait loci (caQTL) help identify GWAS loci that may alter GWAS\
    \ traits by modulating chromatin structure, but caQTL have been identified in\
    \ a limited set of human tissues. Here we mapped caQTL in human liver tissue in\
    \ 20 liver samples and identified 3,123 caQTL. The caQTL variants are enriched\
    \ in liver tissue promoter and enhancer states and frequently disrupt binding\
    \ motifs of transcription factors expressed in liver. We predicted target genes\
    \ for 861 caQTL peaks using proximity, chromatin interactions, correlation with\
    \ promoter accessibility or gene expression, and colocalization with expression\
    \ QTL. Using GWAS signals for 19 liver function and/or cardiometabolic traits,\
    \ we identified 110 colocalized caQTL and GWAS signals, 56 of which contained\
    \ a predicted caPeak target gene. At the LITAF LDL-cholesterol GWAS locus, we\
    \ validated that a caQTL variant showed allelic differences in protein binding\
    \ and transcriptional activity. These caQTL contribute to the epigenomic characterization\
    \ of human liver and help identify molecular mechanisms and genes at GWAS loci."

    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Omni-ATAC-seq protocol. We pulverized 50-mg pieces of frozen human liver tissue in liquid nitrogen using a Cell Crusher (CellCrusher, Cork Island), homogenized the tissue powder in ice cold nuclei isolation buffer (NIB: 20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM EDTA, 5 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.1% mercaptoethanol, 40% glycerol, pH 7.5) using a 1-mL dounce for 40 strokes, and rotated for 5 minutes at 4oC. We filtered the solution through a Miracloth (Calbiochem, San Diego, Ca USA), centrifuged at 1100g for 10 minutes at 4oC, washed the pellet with 250-uL NIB containing 0.5% Triton-X, centrifuged at 500g for 5 minutes at 4oC, and resuspended the pellet in 250-uL of resuspension buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4). After counting isolated nuclei, we pelleted 50,000 nuclei at 500g for 5 minutes at 4oC for each of three replicate ATAC-seq libraries per sample., Libraries were prepared using Nextera kits (Illumina)"
    sample_description: "The first three digits of raw and processed filenames represent the sample IDs. For each tissue sample, nuclei was extracted and divided into three portions prior to library preparation. This resulted in triplicate libraries for each tissue sample. If a library did not receive high enough sequencing depth, the same library was resequenced. Consequently, some libraries have two sets of raw fastq files, designated by RG1 and RG2. The fastq files are named as follows: 3 digits sample ID followed by a ., number indicating one of the three triplicate libraries followed by _, and RG1 or RG2 indicating the first round of sequencing (all samples) or second round of sequencing (only samples that didn''t reach sufficient read depth on first sequencing run)., consensusNarrowPeaksWithPeakIDs-1bpOverlap-min3samples_liver-firstPass-20samples.bed, DESeq2Datasets_GC-correct_consensusNarrowPeaks-1bpOverlap-min3samples_liver-secondPass-20samples.RData"
