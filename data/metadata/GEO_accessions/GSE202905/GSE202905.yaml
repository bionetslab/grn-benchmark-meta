    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "According to previously published ATAC-seq protocol (Buenrostro J, Wu B, Chang H, Greenleaf W. ATAC-seq: A method for assaying chromatin accessibility genome-wide. Curr Protoc Mol Biol, 2015, 109: 21.29.1-21.29.9). 50,000 cells were used as starting material."
    sample_data_processing: "ChIP-seq reads were trimmed from 3'' end until the final base had a quality score > 30, using Trimmomatic v0.39, discarding reads left with < 35 bp, ChIP-seq reads were aligned to the GRCh37 genome using default parameters in Bowtie2 version 2.3.4.2., Peaks were called uing MACS2 V2.1.1.20160309 with the significance cut-off q-value <=0.05, bedgraph and narrowPeak files were generated using MACS v2 with default settings."
