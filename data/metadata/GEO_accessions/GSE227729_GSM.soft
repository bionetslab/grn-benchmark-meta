!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = Nuclei were isolated from fresh-frozen post-mortem human caudate nucleus and putamen, treated with Tagment DNA TDE1 Enzyme (Illumina, #15027865), labeled with cell type-specific probes and separated by FACS as described by Matlik et al 2023.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was isolated with using MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, #28206)
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was used for PCR amplification with NEBNext® High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, #M0541S) and barcoded Nextera primers (Buenrostro JD et al., 2013, Nat Methods 10, 1213-1218. 10.1038/nmeth.2688). Libraries were pooled for sequencing on NovaSeq6000 (SP 2 x 150bp or SP 2 x 100bp).
!Sample_data_processing = The ATACseq reads were aligned with the hg38 genome from the BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38 Bioconductor package (version 1.4.1) using Rsubread's align method in paired-end mode.
!Sample_data_processing = Normalized bigWigs were created with the rtracklayer package.
