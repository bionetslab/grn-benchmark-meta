  "series_summary": "Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most frequent\
    \ of the keratinocyte-derived malignancies with actinic keratosis (AK) as a precancerous\
    \ lesion. To comprehensively delineate the underlying mechanisms for the whole\
    \ progression from normal skin to AK to invasive cSCC, we performed single-cell\
    \ RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to acquire the transcriptomes of 138,982 cells from 13 samples\
    \ of six patients including AK, squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS), cSCC\
    \ and their normal tissues, covering comprehensive clinical courses of cSCC. We\
    \ identified diverse cell types, including important subtypes with different gene\
    \ expression profiles and functions in major keratinocytes. In SCCIS, we discovered\
    \ the malignant subtypes of basal cells with differential proliferative and migration\
    \ potential. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) analysis screened out multiple\
    \ key driver genes including transcription factors (TFs) along AK to cSCC progression.\
    \ Immunohistochemistry (IHC) / immunofluorescence (IF) experiments and single-cell\
    \ ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data verified the expression changes of these genes.\
    \ The functional experiments confirmed the important roles of these genes in regulating\
    \ cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in cSCC tumor. Furthermore,\
    \ we comprehensively described the tumor microenvironment (TME) landscape and\
    \ potential keratinocyte-TME crosstalk in cSCC providing theoretical basis for\
    \ immunotherapy. Together, our findings provide a valuable resource for deciphering\
    \ the progression from AK to cSCC and identifying potential targets for anticancer\
    \ treatment of cSCC."
