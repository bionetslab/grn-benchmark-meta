    \ albumin (BSA) or BSA conjugated with the saturated fatty acid palmitate (PAL)\
    \ for 24 h. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq was performed with human liver tissue and mouse\
    \ hepatocytes following PAL stimulation."

  "series_summary": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is continuum of disorders among\
    \ which non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is particularly associated with a\
    \ negative prognosis. Hepatocyte lipotoxicity is one of the main pathogenic factors\
    \ of liver fibrosis and NASH. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating this\
    \ process are poorly understood. Here, we integrated transcriptomic and chromatin\
    \ accessibility analyses from human liver and mouse hepatocytes to identify lipotoxicity-sensitive\
    \ transcription factors. We found that several transcription factors that were\
    \ activated in liver from NASH patients and by mouse hepatocyte lipotoxicity.\
    \ Notably, the gene expression linked to lipotoxicity closely correlated with\
    \ transcriptional patters in fibrosis progression in NASH patients. Collectively,\
    \ our findings uncovered novel molecular insights into lipotoxicity-induced NASH."

    sample_treatment_protocol_ch1: "FL83B cells were incubated in 400 µM palmitate diluted in growth medium for 24 h. One percent BSA diluted in growth medium was used as control."
    sample_growth_protocol_ch1: "FL83B mouse hepatocytes (ATCC®, #CRL-2390™) were grown in F-12K medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #21127030) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (growth medium). Cells were maintained at 37°C, 95% O2 and 5% CO2."
    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Nuclei from human liver (15 mg) were isolated using with the Nuclei EZ Prep kit (Sigma-Aldrich, #NUC101) and a glass dounce homogenizer (25 strokes with lose pastel and 25 strokes with tight pastel in ice-cold Nuclei EZ Lysis Buffer). Nuclei were filter through a 40 μm cell strainer and counted before ATAC-seq. On the other hand, Fl83B mouse hepatocytes were seeded in 60 mm plates 24 h before BSA or PAL treatment. Nuclei from human liver and mouse hepatocytes were then used for ATAC-seq as previously described (PMID: 28846090)., Library preparation was performed as previously described (PMID: 28846090)."
    sample_data_processing: "Pair-end sequencing of the libraries was performed using the Illumina NextSeq 500., All data was analysed on the Galaxy platform (https://usegalaxy.eu/). Reads were trimmed with Cutadapt (Galaxy version: 1.16.5) and quality was assessed using FastQC (Galaxy version 0.72+galaxy1). Reads were aligned to the hg38 or mm10 version of the human and mouse genome, respectively, using Bowtie2 (Galaxy version 2.3.4.3+galaxy0). Low quality reads (phred < 30) were filtered out with Filter (Galaxy Version 2.4.1) and duplicated reads were removed with MarkDuplicates (Galaxy version 2.18.2.2). Next, we used Genrich (Galaxy version 0.5+galaxy2) for peak calling (q-value < 0.05), while ChIPseeker (Galaxy version, #1.18.0+galaxy1) was used to annotate peaks."
