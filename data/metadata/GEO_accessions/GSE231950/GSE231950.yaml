  "series_summary": "Disease-initiating mutations in the transcription factor RUNX1\
    \ occur as germline and somatic events that cause leukemias with particularly\
    \ poor prognosis. However, the role of RUNX1 in leukemogenesis is not fully understood\
    \ and effective therapies for RUNX1-mutant leukemias remain elusive. Here, we\
    \ use primary patient samples and a RUNX1 knockout model in primary human hematopoietic\
    \ cells to investigate how RUNX1 loss contributes to leukemic progression and\
    \ to identify targetable vulnerabilities. Surprisingly, we found that RUNX1 loss\
    \ decreased proliferative capacity and stem cell function. However, RUNX1-deficient\
    \ cells selectively upregulated the interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptor. Exposure to\
    \ IL-3, but not other JAK/STAT cytokines, rescued RUNX1 KO proliferative and competitive\
    \ defects. Further, we demonstrated that RUNX1 loss repressed JAK/STAT signaling\
    \ and rendered RUNX1-deficient cells sensitive to JAK inhibitors. Our study identifies\
    \ a dependency of RUNX1-mutant leukemias on IL-3/JAK/STAT signaling, which may\
    \ enable these aggressive blood cancers to be targeted with existing agents."

    sample_data_processing: "read trimming and quality control was performed using trim_galore, Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 reference genome using bowtie2 and the --very-sensitive option, Aligned reads were converted to bam format and sorted using SAMtools, and deduplicated using Picard MarkDuplicates, Reads were subsequently indexed and mitochondrial reads were removed using SAMTools, TagAlign bed files from technical replicate libraries were generated using bedtools, shifted to find ATAC-seq cut sites, and pooled, Peaks were called using MACS2 using p-value cut-off of 0.01 and peaks falling within black list regions (https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/blacklists) were removed, Count matrices were generated using the consensus peak set, and the number of reads in each peak were calculated using the CountOverlaps function from the Iranges package in R."
