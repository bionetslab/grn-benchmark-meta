    \ global alterations in SPP1 chromatin accessibility using Signac/Seurat."

  "series_summary": "Systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD)\
    \ is the leading cause of death in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) with\
    \ unclear pathogenesis and limited treatment options. Evidence strongly supports\
    \ an important role for profibrotic, SPP1-expressing macrophages in SSc-ILD. We\
    \ sought to define the transcriptome and chromatin structural changes of SPP1\
    \ SSc-ILD macrophages, so as to better understand their role in promoting fibrosis\
    \ and to identify transcription factors associated with open chromatin driving\
    \ their altered phenotype."

    sample_data_processing: "For scRNA, FASTQ generation, demultiplexing, barcode assignment, gene counting and antibody counting were performed using 10X Genomics'' Cell Ranger software v6 (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger). For scATAC, FASTQ generation, demultiplexing, barcode assignment, and peak calling were performed using 10X Genomics'' Cell Ranger-ATAC software v1.2.0 (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-atac/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger-atac), Data were aggregated and analyzed using the R packages Seurat v 4.0 and Signac v 1.0.9004 as well as Loupe Browser 3.1.1 (10X  Genomics)"
