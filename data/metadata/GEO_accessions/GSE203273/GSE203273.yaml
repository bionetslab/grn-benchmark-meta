  "series_summary": "The heart, the first organ to develop, undergoes complex morphogenesis\
    \ that when defective results in congenital heart disease (CHD). With current\
    \ therapies, more than 90% of CHD patients survive into adulthood but often suffer\
    \ premature death from heart failure (HF) and non-cardiac causes 1. To gain insight\
    \ into poorly understood disease progression, we performed single nuclear RNA\
    \ sequencing (snRNA-seq) and analyzed more than 157,000 nuclei from donors and\
    \ CHD patients, including hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and Tetralogy\
    \ of Fallot (TOF), two common forms of cyanotic CHD lesions, as well as, dilated\
    \ (DCM) and hypertrophic (HCM) cardiomyopathies. We observed CHD specific cell\
    \ states in cardiomyocytes (CMs) which had evidence of insulin resistance and\
    \ increased FOXO and CRIM1 expression. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) in HLHS had enrichment\
    \ for a low HIPPO and high YAP cell state characteristic of activated CFs. Imaging\
    \ Mass Cytometry (IMC) uncovered the spatially resolved perivascular microenvironment\
    \ consistent with an immunodeficient state in CHD. Peripheral immune cell profiling\
    \ suggested deficient monocytic immunity in CHD in agreement with CHD predilection\
    \ to infection and cancer 2. Our comprehensive CHD phenotyping provides a roadmap\
    \ for future personalized medicine in CHD."

    # Project metadata:
    sample_data_processing: "Reads were mapped to the mouse genome human genome (hg19) or mouse genome (mm9) using Bowtie2 with default paired-end settings. Next, all non-nuclear reads, and improperly paired reads were discarded. Duplicated reads were next removed with picard MarkDuplicates (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard). Peak calling was carried out with MACS2 (callpeak  --nomodel â€“broad). Blacklisted regions removed along with peaks of low sequencing quality (require > q30). Reads were counted for each condition from the comprehensive peak file using bedtools (multicov module)"
