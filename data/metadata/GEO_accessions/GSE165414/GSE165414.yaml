    \ muscle tissue and processed for ATAC-seq. One fraction of the purified cells\
    \ was cultured in vitro and the resulting proliferating myoblasts were processed\
    \ for ATAC-seq analysis. These datasets were then compared to identify loci specific\
    \ for each time point (fresh vs cultured) as well as loci conserved between human\
    \ and murine cells."

    \ main myogenic population accounting for skeletal muscle homeostasis and regeneration.\
    \ Here, using the Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin followed by sequencing\
    \ (ATAC-seq), we investigated the epigenetic landscape of activated human and\
    \ murine satellite cells. Our analysis identified a compendium of putative regulatory\
    \ elements defining activated satellite cells and myoblasts, respectively."

    sample_treatment_protocol_ch1: "Sorted human and murine satellite cells were plated onto 0.1% gelatin coated plates maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2, 5% O2. 500-1000 human satellite cells were plated in a 24-well plate following each isolation. Human cells were cultured using human myoblast culture media: Ham''s/F-10 media (Hyclone) supplemented with 20% FBS (Sigma Aldrich), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermoscientific), 500nM dexamethasone (Cayman Chemical), 2ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Peprotech), 143µM ?-mercaptoethanol (Sigma Aldrich). Murine satellite cells were cultured using murine myoblast culture media: DMEM/F12 medium (Thermoscientific) supplemented with 20% FBS, 5ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.25% chick embryonic extract (US Biological). All cells were sub-cultured when density reached 40-50%."
    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Chromatin accessibility studies were performed following the protocol described by Buenrostro and colleagues (Buenrostro et al., 2015). Except for freshly isolated human cells, which isolation yield ranged between 5,000 and 10,000 cells, all other samples consisted of 50,000 cells (freshly sorted mouse cells, cultured mouse and human cells). Briefly, cells were washed with 200 µl of cold PBS then resuspended in 100 µl of cold lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630), spun at 500 g for 10 minutes at 4°C and resuspended in 50 µl of the transposition reaction mix. Transposition occurred at 37°C for 30 minutes., Transposed DNA was purified using a Qiagen MinElute Kit and eluted in 10µl Elution Buffer. Primer extension followed by PCR amplification using Illumina-compatible adapter-barcodes and final library preparation were performed at the University of Minnesota Genomic Center."
    supplementary_files_format_and_content: "Processed data files represent the output of the comparisons freshly-isolated satellite cells (d0) vs cultured cells (d12 for human and d4-d10 for mouse) analysis using DESeq2. Each row represent one of the loci (100bp window around the summit) idenfied in the ATAC-seq samples (human or mouse), and includes genomic coordinates, log2FC and adjusted p-value (among the other)."
