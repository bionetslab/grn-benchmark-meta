  "series_summary": "The generation of TCR\u03B1\u03B2 and TCR\u03B3\u03B4 T cells\
    \ proceeds through distinct developmental stages in which changing regulatory\
    \ events control differentiation and lineage outcome. To clarify the underlying\
    \ mechanisms, we employed RNAseq, ATACseq and ChIPmentation on well-defined thymocyte\
    \ subsets that represent the continuum of human T cell development. The chromatin\
    \ accessibility dynamics uncover stage-specific regulatory mechanisms and reveal\
    \ that human T-lineage commitment is marked by the GATA3- and BCL11B-dependent\
    \ closing of PU.1 sites. While the \xDF-selection checkpoint is marked by transcriptional\
    \ changes and a temporary increase in H3K27me3 without modifications in open chromatin,\
    \ emerging \u03B3\u03B4 T cells, that originate from common precursors as \xDF\
    -selected cells, show dramatic changes in chromatin accessibility which results\
    \ from strong TCR signaling. Furthermore, we unravel distinct chromatin landscapes\
    \ between CD4 and CD8 \u03B1\u03B2 T cells that support their effector functions\
    \ and reveal gene-specific regulatory mechanism that define mature T cells. This\
    \ resource provides an important framework for studying gene regulatory mechanisms\
    \ that drive human normal and malignant T cell development."

    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "Sorted cells were incubated with a transposition mix (TDE1 Tagment DNA Enzyme, 1X TD buffer and 0.01 % digitonin). Transposed DNA fragments were purified by using Qiagen MinElute PCR purification kit and amplified by PCR., Transposed DNA libraries were prepared with the Nextera Index Kit (24 Indices, 96 Samples) and sequenced as single-end or paired-end 75 bp reads on the NextSeq500 Illumina platform."
    sample_data_processing: "reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (single end sequencing) or NGmerge (paired end sequencing)., Bowtie2 (version 2.2.6) was used to align ATACseq reads to GRCh38 with option --very-sensitive. SAMTools and BEDTools were used for further data handling, removal of duplicate reads and read shifting (4bp on forward and -5bp on reverse strand)., Significant peaks were called with MACS2 from BED files., A matrix containing all significant peaks was made as reference for counting reads from BAM files using the function summarizeOverlaps from the R package GenomicAlignments., Normalization of counts was done using DESeq2 with donor and subset in the design."
