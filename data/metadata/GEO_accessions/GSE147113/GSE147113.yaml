  "series_summary": "We introduce AtacWorks (https://github.com/clara-genomics/AtacWorks),\
    \ a method to denoise and identify accessible chromatin regions from low-coverage\
    \ or low-quality ATAC-seq data. AtacWorks uses a deep neural network to learn\
    \ a mapping between noisy ATAC-seq data and corresponding higher-coverage or higher-quality\
    \ data. We apply this approach to as few as 50 hematopoietic stem cells to identify\
    \ regulatory elements that are differentially-accessible between rare lineage-primed\
    \ cell subpopulations."

    sample_treatment_protocol_ch1: "CD34 positive cells were bead enriched using the CD34 MicroBead Kit UltraPure (Miltenyi Biotec, catalog number 130-100-453) following manufacturer''s instructions. The enriched population was then simultaneously stained with CD45, Lineage cocktail, CD34, CD38, CD45RA and CD90 antibodies in MACS buffer for 20 min at 4°C. Stained cells were then washed with MACS buffer and the CD45+ Lin- CD38- CD34+ CD45RA- CD90+ fraction (HSCs) was FACS sorted using a MoFlo Astrios Cell Sorter (Beckman Coulter)."
    sample_growth_protocol_ch1: "Cryopreserved human bone marrow mononuclear cells were purchased from Allcells (catalog number BM, CR, MNC, 10M). Cells were quickly thawed in a 37°C water bath, rinsed with culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% FBS) and then treated with 0.2 U/μL DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 2 mL of culture medium at room temperature for 15 min. After DNase I treatment, cells were filtered with a 40 μm cell strainer, washed with MACS buffer (1x PBS, 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA), and cell viability and concentration were measured with trypan blue on the TC20 Automated Cell Counter (Bio-Rad). Cell viability was greater than 90% for all samples."
