  "series_summary": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a complex inflammatory disease\
    \ of the vessel wall and often leads to myocardial infarction. Genome-wide association\
    \ studies (GWAS) have now identified over 200 genetic loci associated with CAD.\
    \ The majority of CAD-associated variants are located in noncoding regions of\
    \ the genome, many of which are predicted to regulate chromatin accessibility\
    \ and gene expression. In this study, we performed ATAC-seq in human coronary\
    \ artery patient samples to identify novel chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs)\
    \ and gain additional insights into CAD regulatory mechanisms in vivo."

    sample_treatment_protocol_ch1: "Human hearts were obtained from heart transplant recipients or rejected donor hearts. Hearts were all placed in cardioplegic solution prior to dissection of the left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX), and right coronary arteries (RCA). All coronary artery samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen in the same manner"
    sample_data_processing: "Bulk ATAC-seq sample processing was all conducted using the PEPATAC pipeline (version 0.8.6). This includes alignment, duplicate removal, mitochondrial read removal, and peak-calling"
