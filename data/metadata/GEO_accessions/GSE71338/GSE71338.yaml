  "series_summary": "The goal of this study was to test the effects of biobanking\
    \ on chromatin assessibility, as defined by ATAC-seq.  Human na\xEFve B cells\
    \ were FACS sorted from PBMCs that were either frozen or processed fresh.  A range\
    \ of cell numbers were used to identify technical limitations and reproducibility\
    \ of the ATAC-seq assay on biobanked PBMCs comapred to freshly sorted material.\
    \ To provide insight into a disease process, naive B cells were isolated from\
    \ healthy donors or a biorepository of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus undergoing\
    \ disease flares.  These data identify a unique signature of accessible chromatin\
    \ in SLE B cells."
