    sample_treatment_protocol_ch1: "YFV tetramer- positive and naïve CD8 T cells were sorted from PBMC at indicated time points after vaccination. Pellets from 20,000 cells were washed with cold PBS, then with RSB buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2) and lastly with lysis buffer (RSB buffer + 0.1% NP40 + 0.1% Tween 20). The pellet obtained was then resuspended in the transposase reaction mix (25μL 2× TD buffer, 1μL Illumina transposase and 24μL nuclease-free water) and incubated at 37oC for 30 min."
    sample_extract_protocol_ch1: "DNA from the transposase reaction was purified via a Qiagen MinElute kit., PCR amplification was performed using Nextera PCR primers. The final libraries were quantified using a KAPA Library Quantification Kit and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 by ELIM Biopharm."
