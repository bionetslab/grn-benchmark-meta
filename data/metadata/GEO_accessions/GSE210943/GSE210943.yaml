    \ at 4\u2009\xB0C. Cells were then washed twice with PBS supplemented with 2%\
    \ FCS and 2\u2009mM EDTA (Sigma) before resuspending in PBS and counting. Approximately\
    \ 10,000 cells per sample were loaded onto the 10x Chromium controller. +  + ATAC-Seq\
    \ was performed on 2 samples from the same Ugandan child: one in 2013 when malaria\

    \ insecticide spraying."

  "series_summary": "Natural Killer (NK) cells likely play an important role in immunity\
    \ to malaria, but whether repeated  malaria modifies the NK cell response remains\
    \ unclear. Here, we comprehensively profiled the  NK cell response in a cohort\
    \ of 264 Ugandan children. Repeated malaria exposure was  associated with expansion\
    \ of an atypical, CD56neg population of NK cells that differed  transcriptionally,\
    \ epigenetically, and phenotypically from CD56dim NK cells, including decreased\
    \  expression of PLZF and the Fc receptor g chain, increased histone methylation,\
    \ and increased  protein expression of LAG-3, KIR and LILRB1. CD56neg NK cells\
    \ were highly functional, displaying  greater antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity\
    \ than CD56dim NK cells, and higher frequencies of  these cells were associated\
    \ with protection against symptomatic malaria and high parasite  densities. Importantly,\
    \ following marked reductions in malaria transmission, frequencies of these  cells\
    \ rapidly declined, suggesting that continuous exposure to malaria is required\
    \ to maintain this  modified, adaptive-like NK cell subset."
